"So this happened a couple of hours ago.

Today had been a fantastic day. Had a final interview for a new job, went well and offered the position half an hour after leaving with an offer of more than what I asked for! Weather was stunning, birds were singing, it was a day of good vibes and the best of luck.

In the essence of celebration, the girlfriend proposed to finish work early and go to the beach to celebrate the new job and the glorious weather in one fell swoop! What could go wrong I hear you ask!?

Well.....here comes the fuck up you have been waiting for! I have spent most of the last 2 weeks driving and cooped up on a car. Whilst the girlfriend and her friend were lounging in the sun, I couldn't sit still so was throwing stones back in to the sea.

The other 2 attempted to join in to great amusement (trying and failing to match even half the distance of my throws) and this is where it went wrong.

The girlfriend started walking down the beach and I thought it would be funny to land a stone next to her and make her jump. The aim was perfect. And that's the problem, it was too perfect. Instead of just missing her, as soon as the stone left my hand I knew what was going to happen. As I yelled, knowing I had totally just fucked up, she turned round to watch the stone flying in her direction, directly at her. It was too late. The deed was done. The stone connected straight with her funny bone and bruising and swelling was instant. Feeling in her arm disappeared and just left a searing pain coursing through her arm.

Fortunatly nothing was broken and she is joking about it now (its her funny bone! Its funny right!?) Needless to say, I feel incredibly guilty and know this will never be lived down......

"A few years ago, I was a sweet summer child freshly out of college with zero idea what I wanted to do with my life, I was a homeowner after maternal unit moved overseas and gave the house to me, and I decided to work for a house painting company for one summer while I got my metaphorical ducks in a row. 

The next summer, I was out of the painting business and working as an EMT, which meant sometimes I would have a full day or two off (24 on/48 off). I noticed my house was in some need of paint touch ups, so I decided to do them myself. I had brushes, paint, nothing to do, and some beer, so I went at it one Tuesday afternoon. 

So I’m working on the frame of the front door, dressed in old painter whites and a T-shirt with the sleeves cut off, and I sit down to let the primer dry and have a beer. I’m happily perched on the front step when I notice a can-I-speak-to-your-manager haircut with a face that looks like she just ate 12 lemons staring at me from the sidewalk. My front lawn is decently long and slopes down a hill, but I could see an artery pulsing in her neck from my spot. 

She had a dog next to her, so I just wave and say “cute dog!” I guess my words broke the floodgates, and she unleashed upon me a verbal assault of which I understood about 30%. 

The gist: “HOW DARE YOU DRINK ON THE JOB ON THIS NICE PROPERTY. YOU DON’T DESERVE TO SIT THERE AND WASTE THE HARD EARNED MONEY OF THE WELL EDUCATED PERSON THAT OWNS THIS PLACE”

While I’m pondering this, she’s still spewing frothing condescension at me, which culminated in “UNEDUCATED, LAZY, MENIAL, FREELOADING, IMMIGRANT DRUNKS LIKE YOU ARE WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY”

Well, I’m white. Like, really white. Blond hair, green eyes. Born and raised in the good old US of A. Specifically, in this house. Perhaps I look like some sort of insidious immigrant from far away, so I stand up and make my way down to her, but not before cracking open another beer. 

She’s positively quivering with anger and indignation, her dog is pulling at the leash to say hi to me, and so I bend down to say hello back, when she says “WELL, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?”

I raise myself to my full 6’2” height, which towers over her little 5’ nothing self. She doesn’t back down, and the following conversation ensues. 

Me: “Hello ma’am, what seems to be the problem?”

Her: *scoffs* “*YOU.* Sitting there wasting the homeowner’s money so you can get paid to be a lazy drunk.”

Me: “Oh, I’m being paid? Seems odd, I didn’t feel the need to pay myself for this, but I suppose that could be fun to try.”

Her, gears turning: “Pay yourself? Don’t make me laugh, some deadbeat like you couldn’t afford this house. You need an education for a *real* job.”

I’m wondering what her education fixation is all about, but not caring all that much, I just want to entertain her conversation enough to really get her mad. Maybe her head will explode. 

Me: “Well, I didn’t buy this house, my mother did, but she left it to me when she moved overseas after I graduated from college.”

Her, smirking: “Oh, did you go to *local community college, known for not being that great*? Only someone working as a painter would go there.”

Me: “Actually, if you look at my shirt, you’ll see it says ‘*Ivy League School* Athletics’, which is where I attended school and played a sport. I am in good shape because of that, so I figured I would keep that up by working on improving my own home while having a few beers to cool off in this heat. Did you attend *community college*? Because if so, I can see how you might not be able to understand that.” 

Disclaimer: nothing wrong with that CC, it’s where I got my EMT license. Just wanted to watch her boil, and oh boy did she. 

Her eyes widen bigger than I thought possible, and her mouth starts working like elderly folks‘s do when they’ve lost a lot of teeth, lots of lip twisting. This culminates in her reading her ugly head back, and *spitting on the front of my shirt*. “You probably stole that from someone, you ungrateful piece of shit.”

Okay, wow, not sure what I’m ungrateful for, and ew germs, so I tell her that’s it’s been fun but I’m going to continue working and turn to walk back up the lawn. She grabs the back of my shirt and attempts to pull me backwards, doesn’t work, so I spin around and smack her hand off me. 

She flops like a premier league soccer player, flinging herself all over my lawn, howling like she’s been shot. She’s let go of the dog’s leash, so he comes over to me for pets, happy as a clam.

Her yodeling has brought some neighbors out of their homes, including my cool next door ones. They come over and I give them the story, and ask for their phone to call the cops (mine was inside charging), they laugh and hand it over. I let the cops know that some cootcanoe is gyrating loudly on my lawn, could they please come remove her.   

I return to my work, my cool neighbors probably have started making popcorn. A little while later, I hear the cops arrive, Crazy is still singing her fucked up opera, and starts screaming at the cops a story of a belligerently drunk squatter (who’s painting said site of squatting??) who chased her with a baseball bat and broke her arm in multiple places. Her talons point to me, so I come down and tell the cops the whole story. 

They crack up, apparently they know the nutcase by name, and so they tell her to call her husband to get the dog “again”, and cuff her for trespassing and disorderly conduct. Dog hung out with me until the husband, apologizing profusely, came and got him. He also informed me that they are in divorce proceedings, so that may have made her “crazier than usual”.

Never saw the lady again, thank god, but have developed a neighborly friendship with her ex and the pup. Alls well that ends well.

"Edit: I have to catch my flight to Victoria, I'll try and answer any questions when I get the chance. You can always check out my subreddit /r/SkylerTravels

In August 2016 I began walking from near Toronto, Canada where I live. It took me 322 days to get from there to San Francisco. Along the way I visited 18 states and wore out 8 pairs of shoes. More importantly I met so many incredible people who showed me great kindness and hospitality. With what we hear about this world you'd think I would have had trouble with people at every turn, but just about everyone I met was awesome! 

That last trip was all about me, this trip is about me and my best friend raising money for Alzheimer research! Our plan is to cycle 8,000km over the course of roughly 100 days. To be completely honest, we have very little cycling experience, but we're going to give it our best go. 

If you'd like to donate to the Alzheimer Society of Canada [Click Here](https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/cycling-across-canada-for-alzheimer-research/). If you live in another country, please consider donating to whatever Alzheimer Society you have [link to US](https://act.alz.org/site/Donation2?df_id=32112&mfc_pref=T&32112.donation=form1&set.custom.wt=nov-b)
    
**My Proof:** /r/SkylerTravels, there's hundreds of blog entries from there that should hopefully count.

"English is not my first language but my boyfriend told me that my story maybe popular here., but I'm a business owner in another country with very strict libel laws. If you say something bad about someone doesn't matter if its true or not and it costs them money they can sue you. Its the law in my country and people get sued for it alot

Just to say example if say you man and you are cheating on your wife and I tell your boss ""this man is cheating on his wife"" and your boss fire you, you can sue me because you lose your job because I told your boss. Even though it is true that you are cheating on your wife. Stupid law I think, if not true I understand but if true? Why illegal? Anyway my country not perfect. 

So I own a bar, my bar is very successful. I try and take care of my customers and I'm always at my bar making sure my staff are doing a good job. I also always have events and parties. This I think helps my bar be successful.

So not too long ago I moved my bar to a better location and shortly after the bar owner across the street started to threaten me. She said I was telling people she had illegal people work for her, she said I told people she was selling sex. She said I saying she was ripping people off. I didn't know any of this, I don't even know her. I am busy, I got a bar, I got a family, and I got a normal job too.

Then one day she sends me message and says I need to pay her $25,000 or she will sue me. I need to pay the $25,000 because it is less then what the court would make me pay. I'm angry, I don't know why I need to pay $25,000 for something I didn't do. I think she was just mad at my success.

My boyfriend who is American told me I should speak to a lawyer, it was very stressful. I just want to do business and live a happy life I don't want a fight over stupid stuff. But after a few weeks of her texting me demanding I pay her money I go to a lawyer.

Lawyer told me that I can sue her for blackmail and she can sue me for saying bad things about her. I told my lawyer ""I didn't say good or bad thing about her, I don't even know her"" lawyer says then that's fine because she will have to prove I said bad things about her and if I didn't say anything bad about her she, then she can't win. But I can prove she try and blackmail me. If she want money out of me for saying bad things about her she needs to sue me, not blackmail me.

So I sue her

It took a long time...very long time. Over one year in fact lots of paperwork, back and forth, waiting, very stressful I was pulling out my hair I'm just glad my boys keep me happy and focused. And then the day comes we go infront of Judge.

Judge said that she can't prove I said anything bad about her, and since she can't prove I said anything bad she gets nothing. Judge then told me that I need to get paperwork showing how much money I pay my lawyer. I was smart and I brought it with me. My lawyer was very expensive. Judge then asked how much money my business made. I told Judge and I also brought proof. 

Judge then ordered her to pay 10% of my whole year money because she was trying to blackmail me and that is not ok.

10% was a lot of money, a lot more than $25,000 she had to sell her bar to pay me. 

I was so happy, but you see she had problem...she couldn't sell her bar. No one wanted to buy it because many people say my bar put her bar out of business so why do they want to buy it? When they give her price, it very low price not enough to pay me or give her enough money to do something else. So I told her, lets make deal you give me your bar and we say everything is even. She said that's too much money so I promise to pay her a little bit every month as a ""rent"" and she agreed because she had no choice. So I bought her bar. I got it for a very good price because she had to pay me and she had no money :). In my country is a judge tells you that you have to pay something and you can't pay it then one day they will send you to jail.

So I took her bar and turned into a restaurant which is also doing good. Now I have a good bar, a good restaurant and I'm happy again.

It was very stressful 18~ months, I didn't want to fight her, I don't know why she try and fight me. I think she was just mad. She was always mad and mean which is why I think no one liked her.

" So long story short, I'll be 18 soon but I live at home and my parents are weirdly strict and forbid me to vote. I think this is wrong, and I want to be politically involved, so I registered to vote anyways without telling them, and I just got my voter information card in the mail.

"I am really, really shocked right now.  I migrated our R&D lab (we are a very small team that develop automated scientific instruments) from Windows XP to Windows 10 last year, solving a lot of issues with well, everything, and using VMs to run old windows XP custom data loggers for instruments (weird custom serial APIs).

However, the forced updates, lock-screens, and unsigned-driver issues (serial port adapters, USBASP programmers, etc.) with Windows 10 have been an absolute nightmare.  Its been whack-a-mole with problems due to the changes made on Windows 10 (every other system update requires redefining COM ports), and any attempt to be ""future-proof"" utilizing Microsoft platforms has proven to be a an exercise in futility.

We've been able to leapfrog a few technologies and migrate to very simple cloud-based data storage of instrument testing data (for R&D and for customers), and in doing that we started building up some rudimentary Python & Javascript understanding in house.  Just enough to let us have our IoT systems send data to different cloud-hosted databases.

On a lark I started investigating python-based serial data logging capabilities rather than trying to make our VB-based custom codebase from 20 years ago work.  It is night and day compared to what we used to do.  My AARP-age Ph.D-holding colleagues are buying books on R, Python, Javascript, and Plot.ly after seeing what I was able to do in 3-4 days from a almost 0-coding experience level (Basic when I was a kid, and C in highschool for a class).  

10-20 years ago it was a huge pain to run Linux and open-source software for most of what we do.  Now we have 40-80 line cross-platform scripts that are replacing hundreds of thousands of lines of custom VB code, letting us simplify our instrument data logging APIs.  The robustness of these platforms and APIs today is astounding.

We're now migrating all of our R&D lab workstations to Ubuntu Mate with Anaconda, Plot.ly, Node, and AWS's SDK.  It is absurd how much easier and more effective these platforms are now compared to the offerings from Microsoft.

In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to a newly published article in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to ""refute"" concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.

The sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.

The authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.

""It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,"" co-author Stanton Glantz told The New York Times.

"I was driving down a one way earlier today and stop at a pedestrian crossing to let a man walk across the street. I guess stopping for pedestrians is something aginst the religion of the bitch behind me, because she was having NONE of that.

 This bitch honks her horn, then proceeds to go AROUND my car, almost hitting the guy crossing, and go back into my lane in front of me.

We get to the stoplight and left turns are pretty backed up. She decides that theres room for her big ass Cadillac.

Nope. 

The lane she was trying to get into was already too backed up to let her in, so she's about to block traffic. Seeing her mistake, she puts her car in reverse to back up and get out of the way and get back in the turning lane.

I could've backed up easily, there was a semi behind me that left me with plenty of room. I remembered all the years of almost getting hit by people like her and decided to get petty about it. I back up just far enough for her to get her back wheels in and out of the way. 

Words can't explain the smug feeling of watching 20 cars drive by needing to go around her and giving her the dirtiest looks as they pass. It was like a parade of shame.

A few T_D subscribers [noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5n4hp0/sex_attacks_on_white_women_during_new_years_eve/dc8vs6p/?st=jg7begbu&sh=9b6905a1) that it was [a white supremacist site](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5wg8er/why_trump_is_right_paris_is_no_longer_paris/dea0nro/?st=jg7bi617&sh=9e33f3c8), though I don't think they minded the content so much as they knew it made the sub look bad. As a result many of the future top-level posts with links to the site were downvoted, prompting the white nationalists to change up their strategy. 

Now they just post screencaps of the site with the masthead cropped off and any of the other identifying details removed, but [upon request](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5v1uaz/swedens_globalist_fifth_column_is_training_muslim/ddynict/?st=jg7d6ie3&sh=640fe4a4) a link to the article is included in the comment section:

Back when I was 15 I decided that I was fed up with the failed diets and how I looked and felt. I reached the point where I would always wear spandex underneath my shirts to make it look like I wasnt as big as I really was. I started by cutting my calories to 1200 and eventually raised it to 1500 two months later.

I deleted my old Reddit account named u/NerdyNine because it was filled with dumb posts that I regret. This subreddit kept me going and knowing that I wasn't going through it alone was great. 

I'll be going to USAF basic military training on June 12 for munitions systems. I wouldn't be able to do it without the help of everyone here; thanks to all of your support I will now be able to feel comfortable in my body. 

Edit: Apparently when writing this, I also lose the ability on how to spell. Fixed!

They do their best to survive, his best friend and his wife get killed despite his best efforts. Sirius wants to at least be there for the kid- lol no, he's framed and spends 12 years in literally the most depressing prison on Earth. Escapes, gets his hands on guy that framed him and is about to set things right- nope, it's that night of the month for his buddy, things go to hell. Sirius tries to live his life and at least be there for his godson- dictator returns, Sirius still widely regarded as criminal, stuck all but a prisoner in childhood home he hates, feeling useless and taking jabs for not being able to do enough. And when he finally manages to help, he gets killed. The guy keeps overcoming shitty situations and coming within arm's reach of actual happiness, again and again,but whatever he does, he never really manages to catch a break, and after all that, gets killed some 2 years before the happy ending.

"In a world where everyone has superpowers, having no power is a terrible thing. 

It only happens once every several generations, and always alerts the curiosity of the whole world. In the past, the birth of a *null*, as they were now known, had heralded a period of great turmoil. They were the source of superstition and ritual, so it was no surprise that people tried to kill or control them as soon as they heard about them.

Today, things had become marginally more civilised…but only marginally. There was nowhere for a *null* to turn for help; they were so rare that they didn’t factor into anyone’s thoughts even remotely. That is, until I was born. 

The hospital where I was delivered hadn’t bothered to check for manacytes in my blood. Why would they? It was only when my parents took me in for further tests when I was a child and hadn’t manifested yet, and even then only after a veritable battery of tests had been done beforehand that the doctors suggested they test for manacyte deficiency. They had their work cut out convincing my parents it was the right thing to do. Who would want a *null* for a child? “You’ll always be our baby, no matter what” they’d said. 

The test results proved them wrong. 

The minute they saw what I was, they changed their tune. “It must be a mistake…did they make a mistake with the babies in the hospital?”. They were cold to me from then on, and didn’t need much convincing when the doctors offered to keep me in the facility for more tests. They needed even less convincing when the authorities asked them to sign me over to them for permanent guardianship. 

The last I heard of them, my father had divorced my mother on the grounds that she had been unfaithful, while she maintained vehemently that she had never broken her vows. 

That was all I remembered of warmth, of family. From then on it was a world of cold and loneliness.  I knew they hadn’t meant it at the time, but I still held on to my memories of my parents from before my diagnosis. It helped me get through the daily barrage of tests and exercises they made me do. The physical tests were easy to get used to, after a while. I could distract myself from the pain eventually. The psychological tests were what I abhorred most. 

I didn’t know much about myself, but I knew I was a psychopath. I had once overheard one of them saying “well of course there’s psychopathic tendencies here. What do you expect when all we do is prod and poke it like cattle? Christ, George, it doesn’t know what human warmth even is!”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today was different.

I wasn’t woken up by the guard that would take me to my morning intravenous ration. I didn’t know how I knew it, but I had woken up early, and the moon was out. I just *knew* it was. I sat up straight on the edge of my bed, looking down at my hands. I found them profoundly fascinating for some reason. And I felt…*different*. As I held my hands up to my face, I noticed the dim red glow of the surveillance drone. The guard would be here any minute. 

He was a Newtonian; he could affect one of the forces around him. His speciality was Gravity. He had used it to slam me into walls or contort me into all manner of twisted shapes when I had done something to displease him. 

As I heard his footsteps getting closer and louder, I felt something I hadn’t felt before. Confidence. 

He slammed the door open and held out his hand, ready to twist me back into bed. It was then that I did something I hadn’t done in a long time; I spoke. As I felt him take his stance, ready to use his powers on me, something in me urged me to scream. 

“**No!**”

If he was startled by my sudden verbalisations, he didn’t show it. He twisted his fingers, ready to throw me against the wall. I closed my eyes and braced myself for impact. 

Nothing happened. 

I opened my eyes to a look of utter bewilderment on his face. I heard his superior chime in on his comms device. “What’s taking so long? Get on with it”. He shook his head, a look of determination replacing his bewildered expression, and took his stance again. 

Nothing. 

He hadn’t figured it out yet, but I had. I started walking over to him, smiling. The look of confusion turned to terror as he noticed me pacing towards him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“I’ve studied the tapes over and over again. Why yes, I do have a theory as to what happened. Do you know how long we’ve been calling them “*nulls*”? No? Neither does anyone else, which means the word is at least as old as the English language. All this time we thought it referred to the fact that they didn’t have any powers, George. No manacytes in the blood. But it’s more than that. They can *nullify* the powers of others, George. That’s where the term comes from. Someone, long ago, discovered this fact about them and it was lost through the ages…no doubt the countless wars fought in their name had something to do with it. That’s what happened with the guards and the scientists that were cut down during the escape. They simply didn’t know how to react to not having something they took for granted all their lives. Imagine being in their position, George. It’s like suddenly losing a limb! Proceed with caution. We don’t know the full extent of this ability to nullify. Be careful!”

EDIT 1: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to read my story, and to provide feedback or comment on this thread. It's spurred me on to think about this world more and I'm really excited to write more! Reddit gold, that's very generous, thank you!

EDIT 2: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8d1wh3/wp_in_a_world_where_everyone_is_born_with_super/) is a link to the original WP. I've since deleted my reply to the thread as I've posted it here. 

EDIT 3: I've been working on expanding this story. Jumping off [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8de37y/piin_a_world_where_everyone_is_born_with_super/dxmlr1b/) comment I made earlier, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8cn7we/wp_you_are_a_normal_person_with_a_superpowered/dxgkwer/) is the story about the brother of a Von Neumann based on one of my earlier stories (I mean to change some of the details to keep with the theme of the universe). I want to use their story as a vehicle to convey how the social and political structure works in a world with super-powered beings. I also mean to provide greater coverage on how the powers work, specifically in terms to limitations around their use.

"Location: West Virginia, US

Hi everyone, many of you requested an update, so here it is. I locked my last post because I was worried about the amount of visibility I was getting before an investigation could take place. I really wish I could say it is a positive update where justice was properly served, but unfortunately that’s not how small town politics work. More legal advice requested near the bottom. 

As many of you suggested, I reported the events to the Office of Inspector General. Instead of handling it as I thought they would, my complaint was volleyed around between the OIG, the US Postal Inspection Service, and the USPS Consumer and Industry Contact Office for awhile. It seemed like nobody I spoke to wanted to take me seriously because it was my parents stealing my mail and not Stranger Bob. Anyway, I finally got in contact with a very understanding woman at the USPIS who took my report, reaffirmed that what happened to me was a crime, and assured me that this would be investigated. 

Well…it wasn’t. My complaint went right back to the Consumer and Industry Contact Office, where, for whatever earthly reason, it was forwarded directly to my mom’s friend and the PO employee responsible (We’ll call her Nancy) for her to handle. Instead of a crime, these events have been considered a customer service issue and were passed on to Nancy to smooth over herself. Within an hour, I received a very frantic and typo-rich email from Nancy in which she explained that she “didn’t think it was a problem” and offered me a brisk apology. She “now knows I only want my mail delivered to whatever it is addressed” and encouraged me from now on to trust her to send my mail to the proper location. Moreover, I am almost certain she told my mother that I reported her, because my mother has been more unfriendly towards me than usual when I have spoken to my parents (not that being ignored by her is necessarily a bad thing). 

I haven’t been able to get a PO Box in a nearby town yet, but as soon as my final exams are over, that is the plan. In the meantime, all of the other mail I have received from scholarship organizations, tax returns, etc. have arrived as they should at my current address. 

I suppose my question is, what more can I do here? Who else is there to contact? I feel as if my rights and confidentiality have been violated, and that even if I have my passport back, I have no idea what other mail has been stolen from me in the two years since I moved out of my parents’ house. Is this really not a legal issue, and should a poorly-worded apology be all I expected to come from this? 

Again, many thanks for your help and support, Reddit.

"One thing that drives me a little nuts about /r/sysadmin is people who have a relatively limited view of the IT industry but don't realize it.

The common misconception on here is that ""IT"" consists of ""help desk"" and ""sysadmin"" and then there is ""coding"" which is a completely separate thing. I think this stuff stems from people in smaller, mostly Microsoft environments.

Meanwhile there are a vast number of jobs in the IT industry. I'm going to go over the different components of a large enterprise IT department just to give people some more background.

**Client Services**

A huge number of people on here talk about ""help desk"" jobs but they really are talking about desktop support jobs since at most smaller companies that's what it really is. The average client services group can roughly be broken down into three components.

* Service Desk (or Help Desk): Think call center, or a place where people can walk up and get their problems solved right on the spot. These people are trained to solve common problems or dig into documentation and also do password resets

* Desktop Support/Field Services/Whatever: they deploy machines, go out and visit you and deal with your problem, etc

* Endpoint Management/Desktop Engineering/whatever: these people try to manage desktops as a large entity like a fleet. Think SCCM, KACE, Jamf Pro, etc.

Smaller companies are going to combine these roles. If you're really small it might all be mashed together as one person. Or it might be 3 people. Or it could be each of these areas is a manager, with 8 team members

**System Administration/Infrastructure/Application Support/etc**

There are a ton of names for this stuff and it can be broken down into a ton of different subgroups if the environment gets large enough. Teams can be broken down in many ways but these are all possible jobs

* Virtualization/Operating Systems: This group runs vSphere, or operating systems on bare metal like Linux or Windows or they might be responsible for Hyper-V

* Collaboration: Think email/Exchange/Office365/SharePoint/

* Identity and Access management: These people run AD, LDAP directories, account creation scripts, and deal with all the attributes and groups and identity management systems like Sailpoint

* Application admins: They may run apache and IIS and custom coded apps and configure CRM/ERP/etc type stuff. This could even be broken down into multiple teams

* Other places might instead organize this stuff into Windows and Unix teams rather than by function

*DBAs: This can also live in other places but these people deal with care and feeding of databases, Oracle and MS SQL and others. This can even be broken down further into infrastructure vs application DBAs

**Business Intelligence/Analytics/Reporting/Big Data**

There are a million different jobs in this area. This is where data warehousing comes in. This is where tools like Crystal Reports and Cognos and BusinessObjects come in. This pool tends to be people with degrees. Look for a lot of analyst titles here

**Various application teams**

Sysadmins might set up and configure an ERP system or a CRM system, but there are often whole teams of analysts who then live in those systems. 

They might run an HR information system or a decision support system or a enterprise resource planning system. These groups may have dotted line reporting to a business leader despite being inside IT. 


**PMO**

Project management office: Some companies will put all their project managers in this area. Others may embed them in the individual teams. A PM could be located in the PMO or a PM could be embedded in an application team.

**Security**

These people usually have a bunch of experience in other IT jobs listed above before they end up in this area. Security is not a place you typically start your career. In addition to security engineers you have people working on policy and auditing and all kinds of non-technical but very important positions that are very much part of IT security.

**Developers**

There may be several teams of developers. Developers can also be embedded in other teams within the IT organization. You'll often find developers on the identity management team. You might need a developer on the CRM team who can do customizations for things the company needs.

**Networking**

If a company gets big enough this can be divided into multiple groups. You have the telecom people who deal with phones. You have the physical plant people who actually deal with all the cables in the walls. (This could also be outsourced). You also have network technicians who install gear and patch stuff in. You have the network engineers that deal with switching and routing. 

**Data center**

This job can be very physical (racking and HVAC monitoring) or even involve some aspects of network or systems jobs. Totally depends on the company.

----

There are also a million other jobs I didn't mention.

People get weird about skills on here. Take for instance ""coding"" which people on here think is somehow some kind of separate thing. Not just developers do this. You might find a network engineer, or a DBA, or a sysadmin on the Exchange team or a identity management person or anyone else writing code.

Who needs to know SQL? business analysts, developers, sysadmins, etc

This is a HUGE field with SOOOO many jobs and the skills are useful on a lot of these.

For anyone wondering there is Embargo until tomorrow night (or Saturday Night) from what i know, so they can't talk about it now.

Text:

"So I know you won’t believe this story, but it’s a good one.

Currently, I’m in college and I’ve never had the best luck with women. I’m not a socially awkward guy, and I’ve been told that I’m pretty flirtatious, but I always get worried in the sprint between first and second base and sort of call things off. I’ve had plenty of chances before but it’s always been awkward for me to actually put emotion into the whole dating scene. Plus, like most guys my age, I’m pretty nervous about letting girls down.

Uh, anyways, there’s this girl that I know from a program that I’m in. She is the secretary at the front desk, and I see her a lot because I work directly with one of the supervisors. A few weeks ago I asked her out and she said yes, but she explained that she didn’t want anything serious because the school year is getting close to ending and I am going back home (out of state) for summer to work for my dad. Me, being as inexperienced as I am, did not understand what that meant at all.

Maybe I have a chance, I think, so I ask her to go with me and some friends to Dave and Busters. We’re with friends, so there it’s pretty casual. We’re playing some shooter game, and we do really good on the first level. All the sudden, she yells “Let’s go” really loud, and everyone kind of laughs. I’m pretty intrigued, so I ask if that’s something she says a lot. She said that she learned it from this show that she watches and she sort of blushes.

Every time she does good in the game, she says it again. When we lose (because these arcade games are rigged) I ask her if she learned it from the NLSS. Her eyes light up and she says that it is, and that she watches the stream sometimes while studying. I’ve got something that we can talk about now, and we strike up a great conversation. She’s great to talk to, and she gets a lot of the memes and stuff, and is really silly about it. My friends start telling me that I should take back to the house me and a couple other guys are leasing. I get nervous, but they push me to do it and I ask her if she wants to go back to my place. She asks if it’s just going to be us, and I get really defensive, but she grabs me and kisses me right there and whispers that she’d love to. It drives me nuts.

Going back home was nerve wracking. I don’t have a car so we buy an uber, and on the way home we sit in the back and talk about NL some more. Every once in a while she’ll whisper something to me about how she’s so glad I finally started talking to her and how she’s been “sizing me up” since I started working at the college. When we get back, I tip the driver and he just looks at me and laughs. We go inside, and I offer her a drink, but she says that she wants to make it and that it will be a surprise so I run upstairs to check out my room.

Good news; it’s relatively clean. I’m no slob and I like to make sure my living space is decent, and I have my own room. Bad news; there is a half- full bowl of pasta just sitting on my dresser. I was eating it a day earlier and I just didn’t finish it and I sort of forgot. I can’t think of anything else at that point but the food and how she’ll think I’m a slob. I grab it and leave my room, but when I get to the staircase, I’m hit with the shock of my life. She’s standing there at he bottom, completely naked, sort of leaned up against the wall like a model. She looks up at me with her bedroom eyes and sort of licks her lips, looking me up and down. I think my brain just shut down at this point. My knees buckle right about then, and I crash down the stairs with the bowl in hand. Fortunately, it hurt my pride more than my body when I feel down the stairs and ravioli on me.",False,2,False,"How I (almost) got with a cute girl because of NL","r/northernlion",False,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8dfstt",False,"dark","public",1886,"self.northernlion","",False,False,False,1886,"self",1524163034.0,True,True,"text","text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2t6sj","8dfstt",0,115,True,"/r/northernlion/comments/8dfstt/how_i_almost_got_with_a_cute_girl_because_of_nl/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/northernlion/comments/8dfstt/how_i_almost_got_with_a_cute_girl_because_of_nl/",28052,False,False,2048,"best"

"There's a story flying under the radar that needs more attention. In October, Congressional Republicans requested 1.2 million documents from the DOJ, in an apparent fishing expedition that was meant to find wrongdoing [1]. This was a major document request that required Rosenstein to hire *dozens* of new staff members and appoint a US Attorney [2].

They didn't find anything substantive (see the Nunes memo), so they've moved on to the next phase of their obstruction plan: trying to use the speed of the document production as a pretext for firing Rosenstein. There's a rumor flying around Capitol Hill which states that House GOP members have *already drafted* articles of impeachment, but haven't filed them yet [3]. In true banana republic fashion, they've already decided he's guilty. Now they're just trying to figure out what the crime is.

There's so way that an impeachment will actually occur, but that's not the point. The whole point is to lay the groundwork for a Rosenstein firing [4]. This cannot be allowed to occur. Journalists need to start asking these congressmen if they've openly discussed trying to give Trump an out. Anyone who has needs to be indicted for obstruction of justice.

"[Here is a link to the memos in full](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4442900-Ex-FBI-Director-James-Comey-s-memos.html)

The Justice Department provided the documents to Congress on Thursday.

The memos include details about several interactions in the first few months of the Trump administration. They include a January 2017 dinner at which Comey says Trump asked him for his loyalty, and a conversation the following month about former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn.

-------------------------------------

**Notes from reading**

Trump told Comey, ""I need loyalty."" To which Comey responded that he would always get honesty. Trump continued, saying he wants ""honest loyalty.""

Trump made multiple mentions of reporters going to jail over leaked information. In one instance, Trump told Comey ""we need to go after the reporters"" after leaks of transcripts of calls with foreign leaders

 * Comey writes ""I explained that I was a fan of pursuing leaks aggressively but that going after reporters was tricky.""

Trump says Putin told him how Russia had ""some of the most beautiful hookers in the world""

Trump told Comey in March 2017 that he would personally sue Christopher Steele and that ""the cloud"" around Russia kept the House from passing AHCA in March 

Comey says in one memo that, at their private dinner, Trump told him that ""Reince doesn't know we are having dinner,"" then later told him ""Reince knows were (sic) are having dinner.""

Trump told Comey, at least twice, that he did not stay overnight in Moscow in 2013. Schiller testified that he did. 

During a conversation with Reince Priebus on February 8, 2017, Priebus checked with Comey to see if they were having a ""private conversation"" and then proceeded to ask whether the FBI had a FISA warrant on Michael Flynn.

Comey also writes Trump says he had “serious reservations” about Flynn in their 1/28 conversation, and explained that Flynn had not told him of a leader who had called him before Teresa May

>Trump on February 8, 2017 told Comey that Putin told him “we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.” 

>Unless I’m mistaken, they’d only officially spoken once at that point, in a call on Jan. 28. Putin talked about hookers in his first call with the new president?

"The Edwardian Era, on both sides of the Atlantic, prior to the outbreak of WWI, seems to me to be a fascinating historical period, an era with one foot in pre-modern history, and the other in the modern world. A world that would be in some ways recognizable to citizens of today (they had primitive cars, telephones and such) in ways past epochs would not have been, and yet a world where Empires were still commonplace and powerful and there were even still some powerful monarchies reigning in Europe with real power. Yet you also had the beginnings of social welfare programs; you had Theodore Roosevelt as President in the U.S.A and his chosen successor, Taft, in this period and you began to see regulations regarding food and worker safety, steps toward more equal rights for women and minorities, as well as America beginning to step onto the world stage as a major player - but at the same time not the behemoth it is today, arguably still a second rate power.

"It's literally a weed and grows like one. 

>A recent Sunday afternoon at the Bridge City Collective cannabis shop in North Portland saw a steady flow of customers.

>Little wonder: A gram of weed was selling for less than the price of a glass of wine.

>The $4 and $5 grams enticed Scotty Saunders, a 24-year-old sporting a gray hoodie, to spend $88 picking out new products to try with a friend. ""We've definitely seen a huge drop in prices,"" he says.

>Across the wood-and-glass counter, Bridge City owner David Alport was less delighted. He says he's never sold marijuana this cheap before.

...

>It turns out Oregonians are good at growing cannabis—too good.

>In February, state officials announced that 1.1 million pounds of cannabis flower were logged in the state's database.

>If a million pounds sounds like a lot of pot, that's because it is: Last year, Oregonians smoked, vaped or otherwise consumed just under 340,000 pounds of legal bud.

>That means Oregon farmers have grown three times what their clientele can smoke in a year.

>Yet state documents show the number of Oregon weed farmers is poised to double this summer—without much regard to whether there's demand to fill.

>The result? Prices are dropping to unprecedented lows in auction houses and on dispensary counters across the state.

"Nearly my whole life I had a frequent, strange occurance. It wasn't until very recently that I discovered the cause. I'll try my best to recount these events as precisely and coherently as I can. 

I remember the first time it happened. I was sitting in my 7th grade history class idly twirling a strand of hair while Mr. Robinson was writing on the white board. I felt a tiny drop on my shoulder. So small that if I had actually been paying attention in class I would have never noticed it. I instinctively put my hand on my shoulder to wipe away the wetness, but to my surprise it was dry. I glanced up at the ceiling expecting to see a leak. Nothing. I made a quick turn and looked behind me. There was nothing other than an empty desk.  Years passed and I never gave that incident another thought- until it happened again. I was perched up on my bathroom counter, both knees on opposite sides of the sink examining my face for any blemishes, and it happened. The drop hit my shoulder. The same spot. With no evidence it was ever there. Not a tiny speckle of water was on my shoulder. It was completely dry. I had told my mom about the strange event that just took place. She simply glanced up from the book she was reading, took one look at my face and said, ""Honey, what have I told you about picking at your face? You're as red as a tomato. You'll grow out of pimples, but you cant grow out of scars."" She was right, the pimples went away as I got older, but the dripping never did. 

It wasn't frequent. I'd feel the familiar drop every two or three years. Just enough so I could never think I'd made it up. I'd learned to drive, gotten a dog, gotten married, bought a house, and had two children all while the drops kept falling on my shoulder. It was never a problem, mostly just a mild inconvenience I'd assumed was a side effect of stress. 

But eventually things got worse. I was sitting at work when I felt the drop. I rubbed my shoulder out of habbit, then felt another drop pass straight through my hand and onto my shoulder. It had never happened twice before. I found myself glancing up at the ceiling knowing that nothing would be there. After that day the drops became a monthly occurance. Then weekly. Then daily. I was going to doctors, on all types of medicine, and still- nothing changed. My husband, Tod, grew more concerned with every day that passed. 

Thud! 
""Well it's real to HER! I want solutions. Not theories, not sympathy, not more pills- Solutions!"" I grabbed Tod's clenched up fist off the table. His knuckles were white from the force he landed them with.
""Please, Doctor Shanon. I assure you, I'm not making this up.""
The doctor sighed, ""I understand, but we've tried countless treatments. We've exhausted every option.""
I could see Tod's jaw clenching up. I breathed in deeply trying to maintain the peace. ""Is there anything else we can try?"" I could hear the pleading in my own voice. The constant dripping was driving me crazy. I just wanted it to stop. The Doctor crossed her legs and sat up, ""Well we do have a few more options, but you have to understand that with these things there are certain-"" She stopped mid sentence. Mouth still slightly agap, eyes still focused on mine. 

""Doctor Shanon?"" 
The edges of her lips began to twitch. A small gurgling sound was coming out of her mouth from somewhere deep in her throat. Something about it was inherently wrong. Unnatural. Her pupils dilated as she slowly raised her hand and pointed a finger at me. I sat there frozen. Horrified by what I was seeing, but unable to look away.
""What the fuck,"" Tod muttered under his breath, as he opened the door to the hallway and called for help. Doctor Shanon's eyes rolled to the back of her head as she continued to point at me. The gurgling sound becoming louder. Angrier. Another doctor walked into the room and quickly made his way to her. Just as he reached her she began speaking very quietly. Repeating the same thing over and over, voice still gurgiling, finger still pointing,
""Duérmete niño. Duérmete ya. Que viene el lobo. Y te llevará.""

Tod shook his head as we made our way down the hallway towards the exit. ""These doctors are idiots. I mean really, she had the audacity to call you crazy when clearly she's the one with the issues."" I normally would have laughed, but instead I placed my shaking hand in his. ""My mother used to sing that lullaby to me."" Tod looked down at me, ""You mean that crap she was saying?"" I nodded slowly. ""It's a song meant to scare children to sleep. If they stay awake the lobo will get them.""
""Lobo?""
""It means wolf.""
Tod let out a small chuckle as we reached the exit. I wished for a moment I could be as unphased as he was, but something felt wrong deep in my gut. 

I felt the rain as soon we stepped outside. ""The Hell?"" I moaned as I fumbled around in my bag for my umbrella. I could feel my clothes already getting damp. ""I thought we were in for a sunny weekend."" I snapped open the umbrella and caught Tod giving me a strange look. ""Maria, its not raining"" I laughed a little before I realized he was serious. I outstretched my arm and saw it was dry. ""No I- I can feel it everywhere, Tod."" He gave me a sad look full of pity I didn't want. ""I can fucking feel it"" Even the umbrella was no help. The drops were all over me. I slapped my arms, slapped my legs, slapped every bit of skin I could see, but the damn drips didn't stop. It was too much to handle. I broke down in tears, collapsing to my knees as Tod dropped down to cradle my head in his arms. ""I just want it to stop,"" I sobbed. Tod rubbed my back gently, quietly whispering next to my head. ""What's wrong with me?"" I cried into his shoulder for what felt like hours. After I'd calmed down, I wiped the tears and snot from my face. ""I'm sorry,"" I sniffled.

Tod whispered something just quietly enough that I couldn't quite hear it. ""What?"" I asked as I pulled back to get a look at his face. His eyes were white and he was pointing at me, whispering. ""Tod, stop it."" I pulled myself out of his arms, but he just sat there frozen, whispering quietly. ""This isn't funny Tod."" He didn't even blink. I leaned in to hear what he was saying. He was repeating just one word: Lobo. My heart skipped a beat. The world fell silent. Tod sat there quietly still pointing, and in a moment of horror I realized he wasnt pointing at me, he was pointing behind me.

I gathered every bit of courage I had and turned around. I vommitted when I saw him. He was darker than the night sky and stood nearly 9 feet tall. His arms stretched out twice that length, with faces filling in every twist and turn. Faces full of anger, hate, despair, and agony. Faces that deformed, rotted, and then reincarnated right before my eyes. Out of all the faces, his was the worse. It was as if he'd found a wolf, cut off its face, and plastered it onto his. He wrenched of death and decay. Something deep within me knew that this was an ancient being. It was instinct. Every fiber of my being was screaming for me to get away. He reached out towards me, and I sat there frozen in fear as his arms tripled in length. I knew I should have ran, should have screamed, should have done anything, but all I could focus on was the face at the tip of his right arm. My face. Twisted in a million different ways.

What happened next was a blur. I wish I could say I remember how I got away- if I got away, but I don't. I just remember suddenly being held in my mothers arms, and I'm ashamed to say I punched her. She forgave me of course, being in the state of fear and confusion I was in. I remember the doctor muttering how ""unbelievable"" this was under his breathe. I remember countless tests, but I'll never remember anything quite as vividly as I remember him. 

My name is Maria Avila. I'm 13 years old. I was in a coma for 4 months. A leak saved my life. A leak right above my shoulder, that had only been dripping for 12 minutes. The doctors call it a miracle. After hearing my story, my mom claims it was her lullaby that woke me. I imagined 30 years worth of life, my husband, my children, all of it, in 12 small minutes. I'm here to warn you. If you ever feel a drip you can't explain. Or perhaps a small breeze no one else can feel, wake up. The Lobo is lurking, and he's itching to gain a new face.",False,0,False,"Don't ignore the drip","r/nosleep",False,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8dgghy",False,"dark","public",1172,"self.nosleep","",False,False,False,1172,"self",1524198013.0,True,True,"text","text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2rm4d","8dgghy",0,56,True,"/r/nosleep/comments/8dgghy/dont_ignore_the_drip/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8dgghy/dont_ignore_the_drip/",12205863,False,False,2048,"best"

I get it, she's intended to stop flankers and dives, but her kit extends so much further than that. 

She can essentially 1v1 any hero no problem (except maybe tanks), since her mace range and attack speed is insane, and the healing she gets is not bad.

"#Hi people of reddit. Tomorrow **The Way Remastered** hits eShop and it has a **game-breaking bug**.


After about 2h of playing, during second boss fight, the game might crash and erase your whole save data. The **patch** for the issue (and a couple others) is already **submitted** to Nintendo and should be live **soon**. We're really sorry, but that's the best we can do. If you like the game, consider waiting for the patch to fix the issue.

&nbsp;

We thought about delaying the release date, but after speaking with Nintendo, we've decided that it would be worse, because so many people have already preordered the game.  
EDIT: *After reading some comments I think this phrase needs a clarification. Actually, Nintendo said that it would be next to impossible to delay the release because of preorders. We didn't want to press them too much.*

&nbsp;

However, if you already bought the game on pre-purchase (or don't want to wait for the patch and play it right away), you have to follow instructions below:

&nbsp;

####Preparations:

- the game crashes after **second chase**, when you have to figure out how to kill the boss,
- because data saving occurs during closing the game - if you didn't do it previously - you will lose your save,
- to ensure that you don't lose your save, **close the game during second chase sequence** to save the game

####Killing the boss (see image below):

- you have to kill the boss within **2 minutes 30 seconds**, otherwise the game will crash 
- **(1)** collect the sphere in the center of arena, cutscene will play,
- **(2)** go to terminal on upper left and use sphere (**ZR**)
- **(arrows)** use ladder to go underground via newly opened shaft,
- **(3 - 4)** watch out for the enemy's paws, use sphere on underground consoles on far-left and far-right,
- **(5)** go back up, use sphere on upper-left terminal to close the shaft, then **(6)** on upper-middle terminal to pour water, finally: **(7)** use upper-right terminal to open electricity circuit and kill the boss
- congratulations, you evaded a game crash!

Here's an **image** explaining how to evade the bug: http://sonkagames.com/press/not_dog.jpg


*There will also be a news on Switch news channel explaining the issue.*

&nbsp;

Pssst, just to let you know, today is the last day of preorder discount, so... yeah, maybe later.

"My son is 18 and we generally get along pretty well, though he's going through his own life and I'm trying to respect that.

So I came home after work, him after school, I decided to visit his room to ask him what he wanted for dinner and to maybe play some Mario Kart.

I'm still mortified at what I found...

I walk in, fully clothed my son's girlfriend is on all fours on the bed, my son's face is buried into her butt... She stares at me with the widest eyes I've ever seen and within milliseconds releases what can only be described as the ""Horns of the apocalypse"" and farts directly into my son's face. 

He falls backward off the bed, brings down an entire table on top of him, she falls off the front of the bed flipped completely upside down, vertically. He yells ""dad!!"" when suddenly the contents of his entertainment center come crashing down on him.

I rush to his aid, the room smells of some kind of mix of tunafish and hard boiled eggs. My son's pants are down, he's crying and I'm panicking trying to unbury him below the rubble. 

His girlfriend then runs out of the room and heads for the bathroom, all I can hear are explosive noises that could break glass with soundwaves.

My son is bleeding, I haven't said one word at this point. I muster the strength I have to get him to the car for an ER visit. I try to get his girlfriend but all I hear from the bathroom is a mix of crying and fart trumpets exploding.

In a moment of weakness I back up and just leave my house locking the door.

My son's alright now, physically anyway. I'll update if he gets pink eye. His girlfriend hasn't contacted us so I can assume she's still going to town. I'm no longer hungry so dinner's out.

"I posted this story on /r/iPhone and was told to post here too. 

So I just got a reply from Tim Cook.

It all started 19th February when after fighting depression for a few months, my 87 year old grandmother passed away. I lived with her and my mom for 25 years and she was an inspiration for both of us.

She was Italian and had to hide on the montains during WW2, during which she managed to come to Brazil where she got married.

Since December we knew she was short on time so me, my fiancée, my sisters and my mom did everything on our reach so she could get comfortable and enjoy her days. We got the family reunited every weekend, we cooked everything she liked, took a lot of photos of all of us and tried our best to show her how much we loved and cared for her.

Unfortunately, she passed away 10 days after my birthday, tomorrow will be exactly 2 months, on her home, surrounded by her children.

Since that happened, I lost most of my strengths, didn´t want to get out of bed, stood on her old bedroom a lot and started taking anti depressives.

Last week my sister went home and we started sharing photos we had of her and I got a few I didn´t had. I never have my phone volume on, but this day it was and as they all have iPhones, I 3D-Touched the photo to see the LivePhoto and that´s when it hit me that the LivePhoto´s have sounds.

I guess it was the first time I truly smiled in this 2 months when I heard her laughing on this LivePhoto. She was so happy and enjoying that day that I couldn´t stop watching this short video and the others where she was talking.

I heard cases when Tim Cook answers a few emails and decided to send him this story, thanking him for the sound that is recorded on the LivePhoto and explaining how much it meant to me and that it helped me a lot.

This is not the typical post here on /r/iPhone, but I wanted to share with you guys the response I got and if some of you didn´t know LivePhotos had sound maybe you get a good surprise sometime.

"I should preface this with the fact that I have played this game since alpha, so I have seen this game evolve and grow to the wonderful game it is now. Sure, there are some problems here and there, but it is overall a great game!

Over these few years, we have been noticing just a little bit of mobility and invulnerability creep (not too much) and some of the older heroes have been left behind because mobility is very powerful. In order to remedy this for at least one of the older heroes, I propose these changes below.

Raynor needs a 12s cooldown self-cleanse, with an instant dash that deals damage on the spot and resets on every kill. It should also make him invulnerable for a short amount of time. This would definitely put Raynor at a pretty good spot and allow him to be a meta pick, while still not being too oppressive.

A good level 20 talent for this ability can also be implemented to give him a large power-spike at level 20: Raynor now spawns two banshees that follow him every time he teleports. Also, his teleport cooldown is reduced by 12 seconds and no longer costs mana. Every time it is used he says ""This is Jimmy"" globally.

Now, a lot of you may be thinking that this is a bit overpowered, but if it really does end up being overpowered we can do some things to put him in the right spot. One such change that I think that can be made is to change the universe he is from to Overwatch, allowing him to be a little more powerful, but still apparently not overly oppressive.

"There is a place near my school, I eat there often enough at lunchtime between hours. But it’s always extremely full of people, so the workers don’t particularly notice frequent customers. 
Anyway, uninformed me has only 5£ and it’s an old 5£ note, the new ones have just come out and this place stopped accepting the 5£ notes.
I’m paying and I pull my five pound note out, to which she tells me they don’t accept that anymore, she then asked me if I had card, to which I replied negatively to. I then started to walk away from the counter towards the exit after having handed back my items, she picks them up, and insists I take them, she even says it will come out of her paycheck and I won’t have to pay for it.
I take it. After a bit of argumenting “No no I’m fine” “I insist”.
I come back the next day and see her, I attempt to pay her the 5£ and she refuses says it’s ok and that I could keep it, and still refuses to let me pay for it. But eventually she gives in.
Nice to know that she is ready to give on impulse and that there are people out there.

"(Excuse formatting, mobile post!) 
About a year back, I worked in a family restaurant, it was a Saturday night and we were pretty busy, with all tables reserved, but it was all under control. I was hosting, and we had a family of 8 due in for a birthday. 
As I was making my way back to my station, a group of 8 people walked in, (for the purpose of this story, the big idiot will be referred to as 'BI' and I shall be 'me') the exchange went as follows:

BI  'table for 8'

Me 'No problem, Sir, do you have a reservation?'

BI 'No, I don't think so'

Me 'Ok, well I'm very sorry, but we are fully booked for tonight, but I can take a reservation for another night if you wish?'

BI 'No, if I wanted to eat here another night, I would have come here another night'

My back got RIGHT up

Me 'I understand Sir, I do apologise. I'm afraid all our tables are reserved for tonight, but you're more than welcome to take a seat at the bar if you like, while you choose if you would like to go somewhere else?'

BI 'What about that table over there, (pointing to the birthday table) that's got 8 seats, we'll just sit there!'

Me 'Sorry, that table is reserved for another family, they're due here any minute, if you wait at the bar, we have a 30 min policy, so if the family doesn't turn up, you can take their table'

BI 'Well none of these empty tables have 'reserved' signs on them, so how are we meant to know? Can you not push those two together for us? (Pointing to two tables that weren't even in the same area!)' 

Big Idiot then spots my manager walking past, and grabs her arm to speak to her (which went down about as well as a fart in a lift!)

BI 'EXCUSE ME, there is a table over there that we would like to sit at, but this GIRL here won't let us sit there, we travelled half an hour to get here, and I'm not happy! They don't have any signs on to say they are reserved, so I don't understand!'

My manager, without missing a single beat says 'I'm sorry about that Sir, please wait a second while I sort this out, I won't be long'

Big Idiot is looking pretty pleased with himself at this point, puffs out his chest and gives me the smuggest look he's probably given anyone. Until he spots my manager walking out, with the little reserved signs in her hand (our restaurant used to be self seating), she walks over to my station, checks the diary, and walks over to each empty table, and places a sign on each one, and walks back over to the station.

Manager 'I'm sorry our system confused you Sir, I have now rectified it, I see we have have a free table tomorrow evening, at the same time if you would like to come back then?'

Big Idiot turned the most putrid shade of puce you've ever seen in your life, and stated he will sit at the bar and wait to see if the table cancels, and as they're walking, the birthday table of 8 walks in.

Big Idiot huffs, and beckons his family to leave, at which point, my manager calls over 'If you would like that table for tomorrow, please give us a call, have a nice evening!'

Oh sweet, sweet Karma...

TL;DR Idiot thought he could bully his way to a table that was reserved, because there were no signs, so my manager grabbed all the old ones from the back and placed one on every empty table.

"Hi Reddit! Two weeks ago I posted about my elderly neighbour who lives a secluded lifestyle, and you all gave me ideas on how to improve his life quality! 

For the last two weeks I've been trying everything - asking him to help me with random things here and there, but every time it was a very short interaction.

Three days ago, I came home from a heavy therapy session and was crying. My neighbour was on his balcony and said, 'would you like to talk?' 
I didn't think my crying would be the way we became friends, but.. whatever works, I guess! Today I was with him for a few hours talking about religion, life, and music, over a coffee. He ended up giving me a record player and about 10 vinyls (including Janis Joplin!!!). He told me he was very happy to have my company. He gave me a book about the bible, which really doesn't interest me, but I'm gunna read the whole damn thing so I can converse with him more about religion. He seems to be happy to talk about that. 

Anyway, we did it, reddit!! I've made a friend out of my neighbour. ",False,0,False,"How can I involve my elderly neighbour in my life?

"Brass Dragons are my favorite thing to throw at players when things are moving slowly, or they're stuck somewhere.

For those of you who aren't familiar with these two I'll fill you in.  

These two dragon types are the weakest.  But that's not important because players will rarely find themselves fighting them.  If anything they'd be saving them from tougher dragons.  Blue dragons prey on Brass dragons.

A brass dragon will do something like kidnap a player and then make them solve a maze.  Or dunk them underwater to see how long they can hold their breath.  A brass dragon will debate what it means to have a soul until their victim is just a pile of bones and dust.  They'll hold a grand debate with the greatest minds they can assemble, and the debate is about which kind of giant is the smelliest.  They may bust the PC's out of jail so they can settle an argument between a Satyr and a squirrel.  They might interrupt a fight between the PC and a super tough enemy just to ask them if they've ever met any vegan orcs.   They aren't evil, but they aren't exactly empathetic.  They can be very wacky and are very alien as far as motivations go.  If you're trying to keep your party on-rails in a way that doesn't seem obvious Brass dragons are an excellent tool.  They can even take a humanoid form and interact with the PC's without them knowing he's a dragon.  Think Zucc memes ""ah yes I would love to join you all in a human dinnertime ceremony, and eat cooked human food.  hahaha maybe later we can play human games such as *ah I'm on fire* or *die naturally at an extremely young age*"".  Having an NPC turn into a dragon is a good way to get murder-hobos to stop picking fights with questhooking rando's.

A copper dragon is a prankster.  A copper dragon will crash the king's feast and put a tac cushion on his chair, or bribe a PC to do it.  Copper dragons **do not** have a human sense of humor.  A copper dragons idea of a harmless prank might be an extremely deadly encounter, or not funny at all to the players.  You know how sometimes little kids will tell ""jokes""  that just aren't jokes.  Copper dragons do that **a lot**.  A copper dragon might prank a farmer by replacing his rolling golden fields of wheat with actual gold from his treasure hoard, then when the farmer comes out to marvel at the miracle with his family the dragon will rip his house from the foundations while laughing hysterically and fly off with it.  Maybe he'll use the house for another prank, maybe he'll return it the next day but it's full of pudding and giant ants.  Copper dragons are weird.  They make great one-off npc's, and can make an otherwise tedious session really fun and interesting.

Anyway these two are a great way to bring more of that dnd whimsy feel that I love in my campaigns.  That classic chaos vs. order struggle that's always been in DnD.

"So yesterday I pulled up next to austin at a red light, he was just sitting in his car deadass crying with his head on the wheel listening to africa by Toto I think he had been there for a while cus people where honking their horns trying to get him to move but he just WOULDN'T. I rolled down my window and asked him what the problem was, he said he regreted only eating 7 nugs, he said he could have done 50 if he had been thinking straight but he was too distracted because he was worried Dan would find his halo roleplay series. Anyway Austin went on for a while telling me about his life between his pathetic nug attempt and a couple weeks ago, It turns out Dan has found the Halo Roleplay series and hes blackmailing Austin, threatening to release them if he dosent play fortnite.  He told me the worst part is the rest of the NLSS crew wont do anything about Dan because he has dirt on them all.

Lets all show support for Austin by letting him know we dont care whats in those Halo Roleplay videos and we wont even watch them If Dan leaks them.

"Lo, many years past, so long ago the internet wasn't even a twinkle in Al Gore's eye and people were forced to go to the library to study, my mother, a then sprightly 16 was gathered with a few of her classmates in the school library.

The librarian, an old battle ax with her glasses on a chain and hanky tucked under her watch took exception to their group discussing the project they'd gathered to work on. When staring primly over the rims of her cat-eye glasses failed to hush them, she marched over in her sensible shoes and hissed ""This table is being too loud. This table needs to BE QUIET.""

For a time, the youths (YOUTHHHHESSS) settled down, but in the way of teenagers, the volume crept back up. Much to the ire of the librarian, who once again stomped over and said ""This table is being too loud! This table needs to be QUIET or this table will have to leave!""

Cowed into solemness they carried on in whispered tones until a particularly contentious point wherein someone dared to speak in normal volume.

Again, the grand dame of suppression emerged from behind the desk where she had been stamping checkout cards with vigor and she proclaimed. ""I have told this table to be quiet. This table has not complied and so this table needs to leave!""

Looking from one to another, the students nodded respectfully and packed up their books and papers.

Thanks for all suggestions in the previous thread, I worked on all of them and the uncle that had originally helped me had passed on to the grandma all the steps I was taking to prevent her from taking my son out of country against my wishes. They decided to not go through with it, and have gone on the vacation by themselves. 

This sub was immensely helpful with resources and suggestions for this specific situation and also steps to take to prevent future situations like this.

"Ive heard a lot about how women who take maternity leave are met with an inconcious bias when they return and its kind of expected her priority is her children.

But like shouldnt mothers and fathers prioritise their children over work anyway? 

I feel like paterntiy leave should be treated the same as maternity leave. Both of you should care for the baby especially at the early stages when it needs so much attention.
I know mothers obviously have to recover from the birth, but wouldnt it be better than to have the father around to help?

Why are childrens supposed to be a mothers first priority but not a fathers? Fathers are just as important let them take time off work for their kids. Also it would eliminate the bias. Children should be eveyones first priority.
Parenthood is the responsibility of both parties. Like even if youre not for feminism shouldnt you be for spending time with your kids?

[EDIT 2: fixed the link] 

I had the good fortune of being an extra in Season 6 of Community, so I thought it might be fun to share some of the trivia that I learned while on set. Enjoy!

1. Shooting of season 6 moved to a brand-new location, the CBS Radford lot (seasons 1-5 were shot on the Paramount lot, on the same space that the original Star Trek was filmed, I learned that at Communicon). This was also the lot where Gilligan's Island was filmed.

2. Specifically, most of Community season 6 was shot on one of the building's lower levels, so the vast majority of daylight in the season is artificial. They had crazy lamps everywhere to make it look like daylight. 

3. The show that had just finished taping on the floor above Community is Parks & Rec. So technically, for a brief time, Greendale was just below Pawnee. And on our way out one day, we saw crew for Brooklyn 99 prepping costumes.

4. Everyone on set LOVES Leonard and seemed to treat him really well. It was nice to see everyone, cast, crew, etc., go out of their way to be kind to him. 

5. The intro sequence in s06e01 with the frisbee collapse was written as an explanation about why there was a new giant stone column in the middle of the cafeteria. The idea is that the column was added to provide more stability (when in reality they had to re-build the Greendale cafeteria around it).

"Original blog post: http://bit.ly/2HLSRPp


Hi everyone, today we wanted to provide an update on our servers and server performance. This should fill in the basics of what’s happened over the last few weeks, how we are handling it, and steps we're taking to prevent these issues from happening again. I’ll be posted up in the comments as best I can throughout today to answer questions.


*(Note: To better understand what’s below: A **server** is the physical metal box in the datacenter that hosts several dozen server instances. A **server instance** is the “server” you play on during an Online or Unranked Match, represented by a name seen in the upper-left corner of your game when playing online -- USW734438, USW101-Aftershock, etc.)*


After the [Tournaments Update](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/tournaments-update-follow-up/) was released on April 3, we started seeing a bug that was causing several performance issues in both your game client -- the stuttering you may have seen when opening the Playlist Menu, for example -- and our servers. We fixed the bug in last Thursday’s [v1.44 Hotfix](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/patch-notes-v1-44--tournaments-update-hotfix-/) -- “Fixed an issue that caused stuttering in the game client when secure TCP sockets are closed down” -- but the change allowed a new server-side software issue to surface.


This software issue, which appears to be unique to one of our server providers, was preventing the normal server instance restarts that happen either 1) on a timer, typically every 1-2 days, or 2) when a server instance hits certain triggers, like using too much of the server’s memory. With the automatic restarts not working properly, the servers took a sharp performance nosedive, leading to “lag” even when your ping was low, and poor performance for all players in a match regardless of their location or platform.


Over the last few days, we have upgraded both the operating system and the control panel software on every single server we have with this provider. 99% of these software upgrades will be complete by the time you read this post today. These upgrades fix the software bug and also give us the level of control we need to better pinpoint and address issues as they come up. The server reboots associated with these upgrades give us a fresh perspective on the server instance data we're collecting from them. We’re also looking into server hardware replacements in some regions, which will take several weeks to complete and should be seamless in regards to server access. While we are confident in these updates and changes we’ve made over the last few days, we are continuing to monitor server performance and will take additional action when needed.


Server issues like these are something we never want to see or have our community experience. It’s not fair to you and “fix your servers,” is not something we want Rocket League to be known for. We apologize for the disruption, and we appreciate everyone (the enthusiast community on Reddit in particular) for sticking with us and being patient while we’ve worked through the problem. This is something we absolutely take to heart; it’s a top priority at the studio and has been for the last few weeks. Our affected server provider has been working with us around the clock to implement these software and hardware upgrades, and we have an internal group comprised of Infrastructure, Engineering, Analytics, Production and Community team members tracking this very closely. This group is also looking at the new expanded server data we started collecting shortly before the Tournaments Update went live and we hope that this new information will help us better track down and resolve server reports we previously couldn’t confirm.


If you continue to experience issues while playing online, please let us know through our support team at [support.rocketleague.com](https://support.rocketleague.com) or via [@RL_Support](https://twitter.com/RL_Support) on Twitter -- and we will take any details you can provide to inform any changes or additional fixes we need to make.

"Sometimes diving into this hobby can be overwhelming. I can’t quite figure out BGG, everyone here seems to have played a million more games than I have, and time and money can make the barrier to entry feel a little high (“So much to play!” “Everyone says **XX** is the best game but I can’t find it for less than $100 and my budget is limited,” etc.). And my wife is into games, but not necessarily always the same ones I have, and not all game are great with two anyway.

But I decided to take the plunge and attend my FLGS’s board game night tonight. I got their too early and all the people there were playing Magic or Warhammer, which is fine, but they’re not my thing. I decided to wait a little bit, and eventually people came (turns out I was early) and the store ran a demo of **Palace of Mad King Ludwig**. I came in third, and it’s not like the heavens opened and I met my best friends or anything, but damn if it wasn’t a really great time. The people I played with were very nice and welcoming, nobody was too worried that I kept getting confused by the scoring rules, and overall it was just really fun. I came home and talked my wife’s ear off about how much fun I had, and to top it off a big order of games from Cardhaus had arrived so that I can explore some more this weekend.

Anyway, I’m just excited to finally have a regular place to go play and get to know people and try new things. I’m really looking forward to digging deeper!

"If you’re a self-taught engineer or bootcamp grad, you owe it to yourself to learn computer science. Thankfully, you can give yourself a world-class CS education without investing years and a small fortune in a degree program 💸.

There are plenty of resources out there, but some are better than others. You don’t need yet another “200+ Free Online Courses” listicle. You need answers to these questions:
- Which subjects should you learn, and why?
- What is the best book or video lecture series for each subject?

This guide is our attempt to definitively answer these questions.

This is getting to the point where I want to find a way to send any unknown caller to voicemail automatically...

"Good evening, I’m hospital boi. And you’re watching TFTFD news at 6. People who work at the front desk don’t always get treated in a nice way, but could that soon become illegal? Story at 11. But first, our top story, a woman in a local hospital doesn’t understand what it means to protect patients confidential information. for that we go live to our on the scene reporter, Jim nacho, Jim? 


These are just getting weirder and weirder every week. 

BACKGROUND! 
At my hospital you need to pay for wifi through a contracted third party that is spectate from the hospital, or go down to the international coffee chain down the road. 

So I was working front desk, and a woman comes up and asks for the wifi password. Here’s how the conversation went down. 
Wl = wifi lady 

Me: hi how may I help you? 

Wl: hi there, what’s the wifi password? 

Me: I’m sorry, but you have to pay for wifi here,  or there’s a coffee shop just a little ways down the road. 

Wl: oh, I only need to check my email quickly, can I use your computer for a minute? 

Me: this computer has a lot of sensitive information regarding all of our patients. we aren’t allowed to let anyone see the screen, let alone use it. 

Wl: oh come on, I’ll be really quick, I just need to check my email. 

Me: I’m sorry, but we aren’t allowed to let anyone use it. There is a coffee shop down the street if you want, or you can  pay for the wifi here on your phone. 

Wl: (loud sigh) alright then.

She pulls up her browser on her phone which redirects to the paywall for the internet. She does this while still standing in front of the desk, blocking all of the other people in line. I ask her to step aside so I can assist other people. She Scoffs at me and begrudgingly steps to the side while muttering something along the lines of “I’m spending all this money on wifi I should be able to stand wherever I 


I was in the middle of helping someone else when she yelled “$10 PER DAY!!!!???” She cuts in front of the person I was helping and starts asking if I can make it cheaper. 

Me:Me: The hospital actually hired internet company to set all that up, and they make most of the profits from it, so they are the ones who determine the price. 

Wl: then can you get someone who can lower the price? 

Inner monologue: [uhhh](https://imgur.com/a/LpTuSWL)

Me:  I think the number for the company is on the paywall. 

She calls the number and loudly speaks to some poor soul that I hope posts their version of events on r/talesfromcallcenters   From what I heard, she yelled that I was the rudest person she’d ever met, and at the end she yelled into the phone “you know what? You just lost my business” and hung up. She then walked outside, I assume to the coffee shop.

"A while ago I stopped using Facebook, as I had narrowed my friends list down to mostly family and even then I saw them regularly and had most of their numbers. So then after a while of not using it and now this big data breach I decided to delete my Facebook account. Then I deleted the Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit apps from my phone.

I have major depression and anxiety and take medication, and I live with my parents. I have a job online doing audio transcribing and I take classes from a community college online, so I didn't really do much before. I would wake up mid morning, lay in bed until 11 or 11:30 scrolling on my phone or after falling back asleep, get up, maybe shower before lunch maybe not, have lunch at noon with my dad (he's blind so he stays home and I kinda help out with that), then go back upstairs to my room and play video games or maybe work or maybe do homework or watch youtube/twitch, whatever until dinner time and then help with dishes and then go back upstairs, and then at ""bedtime"" I'd lay in bed for an hour or two scrolling on my phone again. Repeat.

Since Monday this week, when I deleted social media and stuff from my phone, things have already drastically improved. Without the screen time right in front of my face before bed (I use flux on my pc to help out a bit) I've given myself the chance to do some reading in bed, and then I can fall asleep pretty easily because I'm already decently tired. Then I am awake by 8am, which helps me be tired at night by like 10pm. I still play games and watch twitch but I have redirected most of my focus on programming (a hobby I wanna make into a career), and school work again. 

This morning I left my phone and my smart watch in my room when I took a shower (before 10am!) because I knew I didn't need it, even for music. I don't spend a lot of time showering/getting ready anyways, but I don't need to delay my time being productive any more than I have to because I have work to do. I've even been going outside the past few days, and more than just to get the mail and come back in.

My next steps are adding back in exercise, which I used to go to the gym to lift 6 days a week with my friend but since I'm not making much money I stopped my membership, so I'm looking to start doing home exercises. Then I have a few prospects for jobs on the way so then I can get out of the house more.

Just feeling good and wanting to share with everyone. I didn't think anything could help my insomnia until this week, and I didn't think I could really do much apart from sit around leeching off my parents and play video games either.

"I'm pretty much done with this blind fandom, support-the-team-no-matter-what bullshit this subreddit demands. I posted something similar in the game thread, but I've been a Blazer fan for over 20 years. I've lived in Oregon my entire life. I am the opposite of a bandwagon fan. And I'm allowed to be mad and upset and pissed off and embarrassed by this performance. We played like absolute horse shit tonight. New Orleans has had great defensive schemes for our guards, but that stretch in the second quarter where we had 8 turnovers in 9 possessions is simply inexcusable, and a lot of that does come back to effort, like it or not. Stotts has been soundly outcoached this series by a widly regarded bad coach, and that is unacceptable. I'm not throwing Dame under the bus, I'm not demanding a CJ trade, but I do expect that we be competitive in the playoffs after a 3 seed, 49 win season. It is okay for fans to be mad. It is okay for fans to expect better. The only reason the Blazers exist as a thing is because of us- all of us. If y'all are content with mediocre play for the majority of the season, eventually artificially elevated by a 13 game win streak, and then getting absolutely wrecked in the first round, then get out of here.

"I've been doing a lot of self care lately, but still avoiding the MAIN thing that I've been wanting to give a lot of self love to: my fitness.

I've never developed a serious lifestyle of active physical fitness. I run from time to time for mental health and because I love the runner's high, but even then it's for a short distance and only done when I feel like it. One of the first things I think about when I wake up is how much stronger I'd like to feel everyday. I turn 28 next month and I've always said ""one day"". I realized that ""one day"" mentality never happens until you realize that ""now"" is the only time that matters. This now mentality has helped me with so much in my life, but I had an epiphany the other day that I apply it to everything but this in my life.

I don't hate my body. I love it. Really. BUT, I realized that if I truly did love it all the way, I would appreciate it more. Give back to it more. Give it strength and take time to really care for it more.
My body holds everything in me. It's what gets me up in the morning and puts me to bed at night. It's what drives me to work. It's what expels toxins and helps me shed all the bullshit that I don't need. It is constantly working for me 24/7 to breathe and stay alive. If I truly loved my body, I would give back to it not only by nutrition, but by physical fitness. 

Therefore, I decided to get a personal trainer and I start next Tuesday at 2pm. It'll cost a chunk of change monthly, but learning how to have an active life and cultivate healthier habits have been on my mind for far too long to mull around in the ""one day"".

"Fiancé of 3 years and mother of my only son leaves when our son is around 2 years old because, and I quote, “I can’t see myself marrying you”.  She leaves to live with her parents outside of city limits to a nearby small town.  I stay in the old house trying to make it “home” again. At first, we agree on a scheduling plan to see our son that works for me. I get him while she works evening too late. Things appeared to get a little better, we had started texting each other well into the night.  We spend the day together with our son a couple of times so he knows he still has both parents that love him. 

   A month later she starts seeing another guy and all of a sudden, she’s keeping my son from me and decides that her family will watch him.  She starts to be a total bitch to me. Rude text, demanding that I pay child support (will get into that later), and starts saying that I am a horrible father because I don’t ever have my son.  A very short while later she calls to say I will be getting our son more often again. Found out that things didn’t work out with her and her boy toy.  Things are going good and I am spending time with my son. She picks him up one day and sends me a text saying all the same rude things and says her family will start keeping him again. Found out she had a new boy toy. As I am sure you can guess, about a month goes by and I get the call that I can have my son more again. Yup, you guessed it. Things didn’t work out yet again. This time I made sure to spend ALL the time I could with my son.  I take him to different places around our state, like parks and the zoo, almost every day I had him, and bought him anything he wanted or needed but for my house only.  About a month later, yup, the cycle begins again.  I start to notice a pattern, so I take note.  I save texts and call times that state when I “can and can’t have our son”.  

   Here is where we get some back story, when our son was born she was still legally married.  Due to laws regarding this, I couldn’t be put on the birth certificate until he signed a form saying the child wasn’t his.  He was deployed and couldn’t sign them right away so I had to wait. Finally, the day came when he signed the papers and sent them back to her.  Meanwhile in the present, I have asked and asked for her to get the papers and sign them so I can be on my son’s birth certificate. She refuses every time.  I am finally able to get the papers myself and fill out ALL the information I can, all I need is her signature. I present papers and ask for her to sign them. She takes them and says she will look over the information and sign them and get them back to me. A few hours pass and I get a text stated, “if you want on the birth certificate, take me to court.” 


   I proceed to play nice, ask how our son is, get her a gift “from our son” on Mother’s Day and Christmas and so on and so forth. I receive nothing in return aside from hatred and her using our son as a weapon. If I say something that upsets her then she’ll respond with “He won’t be there today”, If I had a friend around that she doesn’t like, her response is “He isn’t going to be there until they stop coming around.”  She tried to control every aspect of my life even though we weren’t together. I started hanging out with an amazing woman that I wound up falling in love with.  It was one of her best friends that she had stopped hanging out with since she moved out of town.  The mother of my son finds out and is FURIOUS.  She says that I had to stop because she’s her friend and I am going to ruin her life as well as mine if I keep seeing her. I tell her I will not let her control who I am with, who I hang out with, or what I say.  She refuses to let me see my son for almost a month straight.  I get him again with very little communication. She tells me one day that I need to start paying child support (there is nothing ordered by a court or a judge saying that I had to pay anything or that she is the legal parent, but because I am not on the birth certificate (…yet) I have no legal rights to him), so I told her that if she wants it that bad “take me to court.”  Fast forward a year, mail comes to my house addressed to “Parent of or legal guardian of (amazing little guys name here)” I open the mail nothing too important at all. I inform her that mail has come and I have opened it.  She threatens to sue me and tells me “YOU are legally not his father, or guardian!  You have NO right opening his mail!  That is a federal offense and I hope you are ready for what will happen if I report you to the police!” At this point I have had enough, I put my plan into action. 
Here is where the revenge starts. 


   I start researching EVERYTHING I can about ways to get on a child’s birth certificate without the other parent’s signature.  I talk to a lawyer who says that he can help.  I show up to his office and he presents some papers that he needs information for. I give him all the information requested and he says he will be in contact with me.  A couple weeks go by and nothing.  Finally, I get a call to meet him at his office. When I show up he lays papers on his desk and says, “I hope this helps” and he leaves his office. I grab the papers and read, they are the parents papers needed to get on the birth certificated WITH HER SIGNITURE! I am excited.  I rush home. I mail the papers off and call the place almost twice a week to check the progress.  I finally get them in the mail, two beautiful birth certificates for my son with me as the father on them!!  She is still being a bitch and using him as a weapon.  I get him only if she feels like I should have him.  I had to beg and beg to see him for even a few hours once a week.  I do it because I love my little guy. I make sure to tell him every time that I love him and I will fight for him. His mom meets another new guy, I believe this one is number 12 in just about a month shy of a year after we split.  I have been with the same woman for almost a year at this point (still her old best friend).  One day my mother (who I do not get along with for personal reasons growing up), decides that because I said she can’t take my son somewhere while I am at work is the same as having an “attitude” she proceeds to text my sons mom and tells her I am saying a whole bunch of stuff that isn’t true. My son’s mom decides that my mom can take him with her for the night instead of me having him” until I can learn to get along with people.” I then proceed to tell her how wrong it is for her to use our son as a weapon, that I have every right that she does to see my son.  She then tells me “YOU are dumb, in our state you have to be on the birth certificate to have rights, which you aren’t, so you don’t!” Surprise surprise! My reply is nothing short of “Guess what?! I AM on his birth certificate!”.  No reply for 3 days.  I send text every day asking how my son is and to ask her to give him loves.  Still no reply. She then asks if I really got on the birth certificate or if I was lying.  I decided to show her how fed up I was with her trying to control my life and the amount of time I’m allowed with my son.  That very day I hired a lawyer that specializes in child custody cases, I dropped the money on the lawyer’s desk and started my paperwork to have her served.  I made sure that I didn’t interfere with her time with our son.  I asked for days and times while his mother is at work, I agreed to pick him up from school when he’s old enough to go, to share every other weekend, every other holiday, she can have him on her birthday and Mother’s Day, I get him on mine and Father’s Day.  I Made sure to give my lawyer literally 50 pages of text from his mother with all the comments on what a bad parent I am, how I never spend time with my son etc. I made sure to include the text where she says I can’t have him.  The lawyer agrees that I have a case.  Now, present day, I have my son for the day after fighting for her for a week.  She is supposed to get served the court papers today or tomorrow. I bought my son all new clothes, toys, he has a new bed, his own GIANT room at my house, I am renting to own where she just lives with her boyfriend, my girlfriend and I got engaged, we have two other children in the house, her children from before we got together, who go to school and daycare so we can show stability. There are witnesses who agreed to sign documents accounting how many people she was with within that year and what all she did while she was away with our son. Her friends have since come to me saying they agree that what she is doing is wrong and are helping me fill out more testimonies against her. She has no idea she is about to be served with papers.  I will keep everyone updated if they would like when I find out more information.
