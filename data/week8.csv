"I'll immediately start by saying I am not sure whether this actually happened or is an urban legend of some sorts. A couple of friends of mine work in consultancy and I have heard this story through them a few times now.

A small company had created a production planning algorithm themselves to calculate an efficient production schedule. Because they are small company, they didn't have the resources and knowledge for a state\-of\-the\-art algorithm. Theirs worked, although the calculation time took up a couple of days. At some point, management decided this is too long and want to cut down on the calculation time and hire a consultancy firm to have a look at it.

The consultant quickly saw the algorithm was coded quite inefficiently and could reduce it to mere minutes, without changing the algorithm itself. Proud as they were with the result, they presented this to management. Unfortunately, management didn't trust the ""new"" results and they couldn't be convinced that the results were exactly the same. This is not uncommon at smaller companies, as they put a lot of trust and pride in anything they make themselves. So management told the consultant ""to make the calculation time longer, it can't be correct in its current state"".

Somewhat defeated, the consultant went back to work and tried to work on his new assignment. He quickly found a very easy way: in the algorithm, he added just a few lines of codes that made the algorithm pause for 24 hours, before doing the same calculation in a matter of minutes. This time management is very excited and very happy with the results! They thank the consultant and both go their own way.

A few years later, the same company is still working with the new algorithm, but they now decided the 24 hours it now takes is too long and want to decrease it even further. They contacted the same consultancy firm for their help.

"This happened some time ago but only just occurred to me as a legitimate TIFU.

A young girl at my work recently had a stroke. It's a relatively small office, everyone knows her and she is well liked, so everyone knew what had happened and supported her in any way they could. A very touching and supportive community.

The stroke rendered her unable to perform her duties properly and as such she was re-allocated to my section (IT). As they were setting up her desk in preparation for her arrival, they needed a keyboard, and I remembered I had a spare one - so I handed it over, thinking nothing of it. Between then and her arrival to the new desk, I quit my job and had left. 

She returned from rehabilitation leave and was due to commence her new job in the IT section. Lighting and other adjustments had been made to her desk to accommodate her condition. She sits down, goes to type in her credentials to log into her PC.. and has an absolute meltdown.

The keyboard I had handed over when setting up her desk was one I had switched all the keys on, to help me learn to touch-type. All the letters were completely jumbled. She thought she was having another stroke - and she knew that another stroke could likely mean death. She thought she was actively dying because I had given her a jumbled keyboard.

I'll never know how many people actually believe me when I say it was not intentional. I wonder myself sometimes, it's such an outrageous coincidence.

TL;DR: Accidentally installed a jumbled keyboard onto a desk to be used by a stroke victim, made her think she was having another stroke and about to die.",False,0,False,"TIFU by accidentally playing a cruel joke on a stroke victim","r/tifu",False,1,0,"","promo_specified",False,"t3_8gvx4n",False,"dark","public",2231,"self.tifu","",False,False,False,2231,"self",False,True,"richtext",1,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2to41","8gvx4n",0,121,True,"/r/tifu/comments/8gvx4n/tifu_by_accidentally_playing_a_cruel_joke_on_a/","promo_specified",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8gvx4n/tifu_by_accidentally_playing_a_cruel_joke_on_a/",13219481,False,False,2048,"best"

"Sorry for the grammatical mistakes, I can't type very well now. I'm in CA.

Hello, as the title say, my mom commited suicide about a week ago or so. I've been busy with the funeral/will/life insurance thing and havent been able to open my email.

I did this today and her landlord sent me an email, three days after she died saying that he'll keep the deposit(which I guess is fair) because of the cleaning/painting/fixing the bullet hole, but that he also wants to be reimbursed because the house value will go down after the suicide and that he and the other tenant(my moms roomate) want financial support for emotional damages

He ended the email giving me two weeks to call and negotiate, if not then he'll take to court

I'm gonna be honest, I don't know if I can get into a legal battle right now, I'm barely functioning but the idea of calling and negotiating how much my moms death devaluated the house made me throw up.

"Kickers still get their normal duties of kicking field goals and kickoffs, but now every wide receiver, running back, quarterback, and defensive player who ever hopes to score now has to have the ability to kick in the PAT. 

Think about the strategy: You‚Äôre down 7, you NEED the PAT to send the game into overtime, now you have to think about who you want to pass the ball to or hand it off to in order to ensure that.

It will lead to a rise of dual threat kickers: kickers who can now run the ball and catch it, eventually the sport will be played exclusively by kickers who will (naturally, via extensive lobbying) change the rules to eliminate touchdowns entirely, scoring only by kicking the ball through the uprights.

"So although this didn't happen in a retail setting, I believe it fits in the spirit of this sub.

One recent afternoon, I was home alone. My preteens (11 and 12) had gone to play with some friends at the park across the street. I had been up late the night before, so I was running on fumes. I fell asleep for a lovely lovely minute in the living room only to be woken moments later by an angry loud banging on my front door.

I groggily answer it. It's a neighbor I vaguely recognize. She of course is wearing yoga pants, pushing a jogging stroller with a wee one inside, and has a stellar RBF.

""You have the blond kids right?"" She barks.

""No, my kids have dark hair like me."" I tell her, wondering WTF she wants.

""Well, you know them right? I see them over here all the time. ""

I tell her that yes, I know them. They are my kids friends.

""Well, where do they live?"" She demands

Now, I'm not about to go giving out private info to strangers, and I can't remember their exact address anyway. ""They live down that street,"" I said pointing around the corner.

""Well, anyway,"" she replies, ""I just wanted to let you know that I have seen those children, ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, cross the street without looking.""

""Ok,"" I said, getting annoyed at this bitch, ""but they are not my kids.""

""Well, I see them over here all the time. What are you going to do about it? It's just not safe!""

""Again,"" I said, ""They are not my kids ""

""WELL, I have seen them on several occasions! Besides, those kids shouldn't be at the park by themselves!""

I just started at her blankly, realizing in my sleepy state that she is a horrible helicopter Mom and that she is never going to get off my porch or STFU ""Okayyyyyy."" I said, ""Thank you for letting me know!"" I then, very gently, closed the door. This was my mistake.

I immediately heard sputtering and yelling. ""HOW DARE YOU slam the door in my face! How rude! I demand you open this door this very minute and speak to me!""

The yelling continues, and I decide this lady has lost her mind. I decide to go out my back door, leaving her yelling on my porch. I run across the street to the park, see my kids and their blond friends and tell them to look both ways.

I then ask my kids to come home. I'm afraid crazy lady will show up with her jogging stroller and make a scene. As we are heading home, dang, I run into said crazy lady barrelling down the side walk towards the park. Shit.

""How dare you SLAM the door on me! You are a very rude horrible person. "" she exclaims.

""Listen lady,"" I tell her while cutting across my back yard. ""Those weren't my kids, but I told them to look both ways. I didn't mean to slam the door on you or to be rude, but you woke me up to complain about kids that aren't even mine. ""

""Well, you didn't need to be sleeping while your kids are at the park anyway!"" She then stomped off to spread her joy elsewhere and I wish the story ended there, except I've heard from other neighbors she is talking trash about us.

She is a lovely gem. Thank goodness she at least isn't my direct next door neighbor!

Tdlr: neighbor wakes me up to complain about kids that aren't mine.

"**Original Post:**
I gave birth to a healthy baby back in January. My husband and I were both first-time parents. Our baby was born perfectly healthy and we were so excited to bring him home. Things were great but soon he started having trouble breastfeeding and we thought it was an issue with latching. What we didn‚Äôt know was that he had contracted an infection and developed sepsis. [He didn‚Äôt have any noticeable symptoms of an illness, other than the difficulty with breastfeeding.]By the time we took him to the hospital it was already too late. He stayed at the hospital for 2 day before he died. 

It‚Äôs been nearly 4 months since he died and I‚Äôm continuing living my life. But every time I stop and sit, I want to curl up into a ball and die. 

I don‚Äôt feel like I can talk to anyone in my family about it. Everyone avoids talking about him with me anyway. 

There is no point to this post other than I just wanted to get it out.

**Update:** This is the first time I have posted on reddit. Earlier this morning, I was feeling sad and alone. I typed up a post just to vent and didn't think anything would come of it. But all the support I have received has been overwhelming. I will share this thread with my husband as well. I'm sure many of the stories in here, which I am slowly reading through, will give him strength as well. I just want to say thank you to everyone for taking time out of the day to read and respond to my story. Thank you for sharing your stories as well and for giving me hope and guidance. But one of the best parts has been being able to share pictures of my beautiful baby with the world. He was so precious; I couldn't wait to show him off. Thank you for letting me do that here. Thank you for making us a part of your day.

-Lots of love from Shafi and his family!

**Update from Shafi's dad:** So I was driving home in traffic today when my wife told me she posted about Shafi on Reddit - and that something like 300k people had viewed the post - and that about 1000 or more had responded.

I have just finished sitting at our laptop for let's see... almost three hours, trying to read every single reply. Apologies if there were one or two I missed, but I did my best and I have to say that I am overwhelmed by the response.

So many fellow club-members sharing their stories with us to make us feel less alone, and so many who have not gone through this, but still took the time to reach out to us strangers.

Thank you so much - to all of you - getting virtual hugs from internet strangers is no small thing for either of us!

PS - A few people asked what color Shafi's eyes were. They were brown, but we didn't know what shade they would end up since my wife has dark brown eyes and I have light ones. Whatever shade they were going to end up, they were beautiful and curious about the world around him.

PPS - I wanted to share a bit about how this whole process has been for me, since there may be other dads that would be interested to hear it, or who feel less alone if they have experienced this kind of loss.

Day-to-day at work: Thank God I have a very understanding workplace and manager who did not do anything to make losing Shafi more difficult for us, and gave us some time to deal with what was happening. That said, after the first few days and weeks people start to give it less thought, or for whatever reason they become less likely to ask how you're doing. I get it, but it can be frustrating. I'm not one to overshare with co-workers, but I do spend eight-plus hours a weekday with these people, and sometimes I wish someone would ask how I'm doing just because I would like to talk about it when it's running through my mind. On the other hand I'm wary about bringing the subject up too much at work, for fear that I could be seen as ""not functioning as well as before,"" ""losing some focus,"" or however a person could label a perceived loss in productivity.

Day-to-day at home: I do talk with my wife about Shafi often, but today I realized that there are occasional times that I say less than I'm thinking. Thank you to so many wonderful folks on this thread for reminding me that I don't have to hold back like that. The times that I have held back, I've only done so because I feel the terrible vividness of so many moments that last day in the hospital. There are times that those visions well up so strongly that they fog your mind from remembering anything pleasant. We have talked about that, though. And lucky for me, my beautiful wife, who gave me our beautiful boy, is ever understanding of me, and she keeps helping me to remember the beauty of our time with him.",False,3,False,"My 2 week old baby died and l‚Äôm utterly lost.","r/TwoXChromosomes",False,1,0,"","promo_specified",False,"t3_8gs3zs",False,"light","public",23340,"self.TwoXChromosomes","",False,False,False,23340,"self",1525416158.0,"self",True,"richtext",1,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2r2jt","8gs3zs",0,1269,True,"/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8gs3zs/my_2_week_old_baby_died_and_lm_utterly_lost/","promo_specified",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8gs3zs/my_2_week_old_baby_died_and_lm_utterly_lost/",11661569,False,False,2048,"best"

"**My 100% Run**

In order to 100% *Breath of the Wild*, according to speed runs as far as I know, there are only four main things you have to complete. They are as follows: 

- Complete all Divine Beasts (.32%) 
- Complete all Shrines (9.60%) 
- Find all Locations (187 or 226, its iffy) (18.08%) 
- Find all 900 Korok Seeds (72%) 

I felt as though just completing the games map to its fullest wasnt truly 100%ing the game. So I continued on trekking and decided to complete much more of the game. My new 100% is as follows: 

- Complete all Main Quests 
- Complete all Shrine Quests 
- Complete all Side Quests 
- Find all Hidden Memories 
- Discover ALL locations (675)^a
- Complete the Hyrule Compendium^b
- Collect all Medals of Honor^c
- Collect all Armors 
     - Upgrade all Armors 

Having done all of this, I felt as though my playthrough was complete, and my experience a little more unique than the standard 100% runs. 

^a. In order to 100% the game, you only have to find a certain number of shrines. This number is disputed between 187 or 226 as far as I'm aware. I wanted to find all 675 locations found in-game. 

^b. Hyrule Compendium to some may be a new thing. Its essentially a photo album with every creature, monster, material, weapon/bow/shield, and type of treasure in Hyrule. 

^c. Medals of Honor are collected from Kilton after defeating all 40 Hinox and Stalnox, all 40 Stone Talus', and all four Moldugas found in the world. 

**Opinion of** *Breath of the Wild*

Even after having done all I have in *Breath of the Wild*, I dont feel burnt out. I feel like now my journey has truly begun, in that I have all the time in the world now to explore every single nook and cranny I haven't touched now. The game is truly a gaming masterpiece, an experience I wont soon forget and will cherish for a long time to come. It has beat out *The Last of Us* as my favorite game I've ever played, which was no easy feat. 

**Pros of** *Breath of the Wild*

- The Story: It was never too ""in your face"" and allowed you to do as you pleased while still telling a gripping narrative. 
- The Art Style: The art style complimented the game so well and helped detail the beauty in the world. 
- The World: The world that was created flowed together so eloquently and freely. 
- The Scenery: This could be included in the world, but to do so would be undermining the sheer beauty that this game is. From looking out from the top of a plateau in the Gerudo Highlands, to scaling up the side and to the top of the Dueling Peaks, the beauty of it all never got old. 
- The Peoples: The peoples of Hyrule were crafted so well and fit into their own part of the world in a wonderful way. Each city of theirs was unique and beautiful. 
- The Champions: They were easily my favorite part of the game. They all had such fun, charismatic personalities that made them all loveable in some way or another. 
- The Shrines: Although most found them repetitive, I found them enjoyable. They gave me a set task to complete and did so in fun little puzzles. 
- The Combat: Another testy opinion, but the combat of *Breath of the Wild* was always enjoyable. The weapon degredation added a whole new layer to combat, resulting in having to change your fighting style to accommodate the weapon equipped. The sheer variety of weapons was also a bonus. 

**Cons of** *Breath of the Wild*

- The Enemy Variety: After fighting what felt like the millionth bokoblin, it made me realize the shallow amount of enemies that were found in the game. 
- Rain, whenever I needed to climb: It felt like it rained too much in the game, which made certain transversal tedious. 
- Lack of Memorable Characters: Aside from Zelda, Impa, Ganon, and the Champions, there weren't that many characters that really stuck out from the rest of the peoples found. 
- No Depth to Side Quests: Most of the side quests in the game ended up being just fetch quests. I wish there were more in depth quests, akin to *The Witcher 3*, so I could become more attached to more characters. 

**Potential Additions to a Sequel**

- Variety in Houses: If you completed the side quests thats involved building Tarrey Town, you were given a house at the end of them. I didnt expect it, and loved it. It was great putting my Champion Weapons on display. However, I wish there were more purchasable houses found around the map and more storage possibilities. This would give me a reason to return home more often. 
- Gardening: This one goes hand in hand with housing. It would be really cool if you had the opportunity to purchase a certain amount of land to plant crops in to grow. Certain crops could only grow in their specific region however. EX) Banana Trees couldn't grow in the Tabantha Region, Apple Trees cant grow in the Wasteland Region. 
- Spouses: I'm not sure if Link is allowed to marry or if he can only marry Zelda or something, but it would be cool if there were certain quests that allowed you to wed someone. Maybe two or three quests per group of peoples that allowed you to choose who you wanted to wed. They could come to live with you in your home as well, in whichever new purchasable home you wanted to reside in in Hyrule. Potentially even marry Zelda and live in Hyrule? (I dont know about this, it might be my love of Skyrim that dictated this want.) 
- Armor Upgrades: Although some, if not all (I cant remember), give you stat buffs after upgrading, I wish they added more upgrading buffs. One that comes to mind involves the Climbers Gear. EX) Upgrading the Climbers Set completely gives you the ability to climb in the rain at normal speed. 
- More Dungeons: Give me elaborate dungeons that take a minute or two to get through. Although I loved the shrines, it would be amazing to explore an abandoned mine in Eldin or a massive sinkhole in the Wasteland. 

**Discussion/Final Thoughts**

What do you guys think of this run? Worth your time, not worth it? What was your favorite part of the game? What was your least favorite part? And if you could add one or two things into a potential sequel, what would you add and why? 

If you took the time to read this, thank you! It really means a lot and I hope I inspired you to do what I did! Cheers! 



**TL:DR** I 100%'d *Breath of the Wild* in what I thought would be a unique way. The game is fantastic, story amazing, and world gorgeous.

My mom then began talking to my dad about the food they would be serving at my graduation party and my mother mentioned the idea of having friend chicken and burgers. 
I piped up and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a celebration of a milestone in my life, I don‚Äôt think we should have meat.‚Äù 

This shit lead to an hour long argument about how me being vegan and wanting to have a gathering without meat was me somehow ‚Äúshoving my agenda‚Äù and that not having meat would ‚Äútear the family apart‚Äù and that ‚Äúno one will show up without meat‚Äù

"[Well... here goes nothing. Progress pics inside.](https://imgur.com/a/AuX3p0M) (Sports bra warning.)

According to MyFitnessPal, it's been exactly 365 days since I started this journey.
And almost poetically, I've hit my goal weight-- actually, I surpassed it a little!

Stats:
F22 | 5'6""
Starting Weight: 186.6
Goal Weight: 135lbs
Current Weight: 134.4lbs

It's been a really hard battle of ups and downs. This year has been brutally hard, from school, personal life, and everything else. But dangit, I made it.

Like a lot of others here, I simply ate things in moderation but still ate what I wanted (sans soda, but I haven't drank that stuff for yearrrssss anyway), and do intermittent fasting (though that's mainly because I get sick if I eat too early, but it does help stop me from midnight snacking :P). I use MyFitnessPal every day to track my food intake and exercise, and had a goal of max 1200cal a day. Did I always stay under that 1200cal mark? Lol no. But what mattered most was being consistent, and holding myself accountable. Everyone has good days, everyone has bad days-- what makes the difference is if you let those bad days define you and keep you down. Don't let that happen... keep your chin up!

I work out occasionally, but it definitely hasn't been the defining factor in my weight loss. It certainly has helped though, so if you do have access to equipment or a free or affordable gym, definitely look into trying things out. I have some issues with my kidney, so high impact cardio is rough-- which means the elliptical has become my best friend for getting cardio in. I highly recommend trying out an elliptical, especially if you want to get some more cardio in and don't like treadmills (or can't use treadmills)! And if the gym is boring for you, maybe try a sport like kickboxing. I've been on and off doing kickboxing routines and it's absolutely awesome. You feel like the coolest kid on the block and also burn calories like hella. Win/win, yo. Just don't kick your TV.

But even beyond food and exercise, there's been one really huge factor in helping me through this journey. And that's you guys. I can confidently say I never could have done this without this amazing community. I don't post a whole lot, but I browse and read your posts every single day. I love the support and knowledge that this sub provides, and I love seeing everyone's progress, and their own ups and downs and what-have-you's. It humanizes the whole process. We're not perfect. So everyone's journeys are all going to be full of road blocks along the way... and for me it was incredibly important to see that. It helped pick me back up when I fell flat on my face.
So yeah, you guys are all amazing.

I've got one big NSV left, and that's to do my first cosplay. I've got it almost all done and I'll be unveiling it at Acen (Anime Central) in a couple weeks. Hopefully I can get some good pictures to share, because honestly-- as silly as it might be-- being able to cosplay and look hella good has been one of my biggest motivations for this change. And as silly as it might be, it's like I saw from /u/Chance4e the other day-- commit to doing something crazy. Make the weight loss part of something else, so you're doing it for more than just losing weight for the sake of it. For me, that's this silly over-the-top Date Masamune cosplay so I can run around with six swords like a samurai warlord Wolverine, screaming at the top of my lungs and not being winded from it. (Dude I'm so excited for this you have nooooo idea.) (Also: Next goal is to have amazing Cloud Strife arms.)

This makes me wonder, what's driving you guys to commit to this journey? I'm curious to hear. :)

"I always thought obsession was immediate. You just see something and instantly know: *I want that. I need that.* 

Maybe that‚Äôs the case for some. But for me, obsession was a slow burn. So slow, I only realized was happening after I‚Äôd caught on fire.

My obsession started with a dating sim. Basically, they‚Äôre choose-your-own-adventure romance games with anime characters. Most games let you personalize your avatar to enhance the self-insertion. It‚Äôs desperately cringey, but harmless.

I‚Äôll be honest: I‚Äôm a weeaboo. Not just any weeb, but the kind that publicly picks ‚ÄúFullmetal Alchemist‚Äù over ‚ÄúStar Wars.‚Äù Perhaps understandably, I didn‚Äôt have many friends, let alone a significant other. I was incredibly lonely.

So maybe my gravitation toward dating sims was inevitable. They all operate on the harem trope, where you‚Äôve inexplicably got twelve characters competing for your affection. It‚Äôs an appealing concept for the emotionally isolated.

I must have tried fifty sims altogether. Most were too pathetic even for me. But I kept coming back to one in particular. Or rather, to one character in particular.

Toru from Ninja Shadow was my guy: older, direct, experienced, self-aware, and hot as hell. At first it was a fun distraction. I‚Äôd log into the app every few days, read a little, pick up avatar items, and call it quits for the week.

But over time, I got *invested.* The thing is, you lose out on stories, items, and promotions if you don‚Äôt log in daily. It only took a couple minutes, so why not? Otherwise I was cheating myself out of in-game perks.

It just went downhill from there. Before I knew it, I was checking in every couple hours to read chapters and collect items. Sometimes I‚Äôd log in just to stare at Toru.

My obsession was the kind of slow descent that basically culminates in a live burial. I spent all my time thinking about Toru. I got anxious if work prevented me from running the app, and I freaked out if I didn‚Äôt earn top ranking for each in-game competition. When avatar items that matched my real-life appearance and style didn‚Äôt match Toru‚Äôs tastes, I felt sick.

And when I found items or made story choices Toru liked, I was over the moon. I rode the high for hours‚Ä¶until another wrong choice derailed everything again.

Toru became my focus, the center of all emotion and desire. I read his story a hundred times. I spent actual money on in-game currency and premium content just to have more of him. The game was the last thing I checked before bed and the first thing I looked at in the morning. He was all I wanted. I would‚Äôve given anything. But he already had my mind and heart. What else was there to give?

I know it‚Äôs profoundly pathetic. But when you have nothing, you grab on to whatever‚Äôs close. This idiotic game was all I had. I knew it wasn‚Äôt real. That was part of why it was so easy; it‚Äôs safe to pour al your energy into a fantasy. 

And it paid off.

Because a couple months ago, I woke up next to Toru.

I stretched lazily, feet pressing against a warm body. I figured it was my dog. I was dimly aware that she seemed too big, but it didn‚Äôt register as wrong. 

At least, not until an arm dropped over my waist.  

I shot up and spun around, tangling in my sheets and nearly falling off the bed.

There he was. Silky white hair, deep blue eyes and a face that could break anyone‚Äôs heart.

Toru.

He was a real, flesh-and-blood person, not a cartoon. But I recognized him anyway: the features possessed that unmistakable chiseled quality, all smooth planes and distinct angles. Not to mention his distinctive coloring.

No, it was definitely Toru. The question was not ‚Äúwho‚Äù, but ‚Äúhow‚Äù. 

A wicked smile spread over his face, accentuating his high, sharp cheekbones. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Isn‚Äôt this what you wanted?‚Äù

Midmorning sunlight streamed through the window, bathing him in an ethereal glow that made him shine like gold-tinged porcelain. 

I know it‚Äôs insane, but whatever resolve I had weakened.

He stood and sauntered over. Light slanted over his skin, throwing his physique into stunning relief. Fear surged through me. He easily topped six and a half feet. Well-defined muscle wrapped every inch of his body. I‚Äôd never be able to defend myself; he could kill me with a well-placed punch. 

I retreated involuntarily. He held his hands out playfully. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid. I‚Äôll never hurt you.‚Äù That grin spiked up his cheek again. ‚ÄúUnless you want me to.‚Äù

What can I say? He‚Äôs literally a dream come true.

The only hiccup was the fact that my dog hated him. I was disappointed, but not surprised. I didn‚Äôt know what I was dealing with, but I knew it wasn‚Äôt right.

I also didn‚Äôt care. He‚Äôd have been perfect just on the basis of his looks, personality, or single-minded focus on me. Put them all altogether, and he was my Shangri-La.

I‚Äôve lived my entire life in the same small town. As is the case with small towns, gossip traveled at the speed of light. My exotically beautiful mystery boyfriend was the talk of the town. 

It took two days for someone to try and seduce him.

I was at work (and I do have to work; Toru is a perfect man, not a rich one) when my landlord came around. She‚Äôs a lovely, successful lady just a couple years older than me. Not a bad person. We went to school together, she was always kind, and she even cut me a break on rent when I lost my part-time job last year.

None of that stopped her from approaching Toru. 

I walked in on the aftermath. 

Bloodstained tatters of cloth and skin littered my living room, accentuated by the occasional clot of glistening viscera. Toru lounged on the sofa, sucking contentedly on a femur. Gore caked his clothes and streaked his pale hair. 

My knees gave out, spilling me to the floor.

Concern flitted over his face. He sat up.

‚ÄúStay there,‚Äù I whispered. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid. It‚Äôs what she deserves.‚Äù His indignant baritone voice was inexplicably soothing. ‚ÄúShe tried to get me into bed. What was I supposed to do?‚Äù 

He swung both feet onto the floor. A clump of dark hair clung to his heel, glued by bloody roots.

My gorge rose. ‚ÄúNot‚Ä¶this?‚Äù

Toru stood up. I  uttered an involuntary sob. His expression twisted in an astonishingly beautiful moue of pain. ‚ÄúI need to eat. I need energy. Traditionally, I‚Äôd take it from you but that‚Äôs not how you made me.‚Äù A broken smile touched his lips. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm glad.‚Äù

My hands closed helplessly on the carpet. Sleek fur slipped between my fingers. Horror and fury bolted through my heart, and I shot to my feet. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my dog?‚Äù Toru stumbled back, sapphire eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to my dog?‚Äù

‚ÄúI locked her in the bedroom. She was interfering.‚Äù

I hurtled down the hall into my room. My dog was safe. Scared, missing some fur, and spattered with my landlord‚Äôs blood, but fine.

I picked her up and cried.

After a while, she stiffened and started to growl.

Toru‚Äôs silky voice came from the doorway: ‚ÄúNot that I‚Äôd hurt her anyway, but animals just don‚Äôt do it. I need human energy. Human lust.‚Äù

My guts contracted. I felt painfully, impossibly cold, like I‚Äôd fallen into the Arctic Ocean. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the catch. I‚Äôll end up like her.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. You don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù He came close and cupped my face. In spite of everything, I felt a thrill of pleasure. My dog immediately went crazy, straining to attack him. Panicked, I dropped her in the hall and closed the door. 

A second later Toru‚Äôs arms went around me. The blood and gore on his clothes had already begun to stink, but I didn‚Äôt care. This was all I wanted. This was heaven.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt hurt you even if I wanted to,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúNot to say I‚Äôm safe. But I‚Äôm not dangerous to you.‚Äù He pulled me close and nuzzled my cheek.

My stomach flipped pleasantly, but fear remained. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúA starving mass of miserable energy bound, shaped and reformed by your desire.‚Äù He sighed contentedly. ‚ÄúIf it makes you feel better, this is the best thing I‚Äôve ever been.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been doing some research. I don‚Äôt know what Toru is for sure, but I‚Äôm leaning toward incubus or tulpa. Either way, the sheer force of my obsession and love for a fantasy drew some form of energy ‚Äì destructive energy, hungry energy ‚Äì and shaped it into something beautiful.

That means I have to keep him, right? Without me, he‚Äôll devolve into a starving, thoughtless monster. Into something that only causes pain.

I didn‚Äôt dream up a birth certificate or social security number for him, which means he can‚Äôt get a real job. So for the last several months, he‚Äôs been working under the table. You meet all kinds of folks when you do odd jobs. Of course, they all want Toru.

Luckily, some of them are bad people who shouldn‚Äôt be alive.

Like he said, Toru needs human meat and lust to live. He *could* take the energy from me, but I must have done a good job making him, because the thought makes him cry. He doesn‚Äôt need to sleep with his prey, but they need to want him. Otherwise, they won‚Äôt sate him. He doesn‚Äôt need much, just one every few months.

I‚Äôm sad about my landlord; she didn‚Äôt deserve that. But I‚Äôm making sure his other victims deserve to die.  I created something both beautiful *and* useful. I mean really, Toru is basically a public service at this point.

I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll last. I know he‚Äôs dangerous and it probably won‚Äôt end well. But until then, I‚Äôll soak it up like a sponge.

Being the weeb I am, I introduced Toru to anime. Now he jokingly refers to himself as my waifu. Most of the time, it makes me feel warm and fuzzy and so in love.

But other times, I get thinking. If I‚Äôm the one obsessed with him, the one who blindly adores him, the one who‚Äôll do anything to keep him happy at any cost‚Ä¶

Doesn‚Äôt that kind of make me the waifu?

"I'm legally blind, meaning it's not completely dark but it's very *very* fuzzy. I wasn't this way my entire life but I remember Kled being on the login screen when I opened it up for the first time after a botched eye surgery and could barely make out a yordle ridding on an... ostrich?

&nbsp;

For a long time, I tried to pretend nothing had changed. Csing was impossible when the minion health bars were practically invisible, I kept losing the small yellow blur that was my mouse, and I got beat in my usual role (mid) unless it honestly seemed as though my opponent has 500 ping.

&nbsp;

I picked up Morgana (W-ing waves is fun) and things got better but my friends at the time got sick of carrying me and stopped playing with me, even the ones I knew from school. I eventually met new people and hid my blindness from them, just told them I was a support main and that's what I became. 

&nbsp;

Right now I play with a locked screen to help with my mouse-losing problems, color-blind mode on, and quick cast (weaned myself off normal cast though the bright blue indicators really helped at first), and I main Nami and Rakan mostly so cs is a nonfactor. For the most part, I feel like I'm just getting by with macro knowledge, especially in ranked (Gold with 100 games played).

&nbsp;

Sometimes I kinda want to just give up but I really love league and the friends I have made through it. I've grown to love being in a duo lane and have recently been trying champs like Xayah and MF because their farming is a bit easier (Xayah after essence reaver and MF using her passive) and that's been... Pretty nice actually. I go into the training tool a lot and practice csing the first few waves over and over again and as long as the minions don't aggro weird I have the timings down pretty well. I will admit to having a small stroke whenever my support autos a minion but relic supports! What a blessing. I miss too many cannons to shotty guesswork.

&nbsp;

Thanks for taking the time to read my story. If you have advice for me, maybe I'm missing something, I'd appreciate anything. Maybe the perfect champ for me is hiding right under my nose (don't say Lee Sin). Most importantly though, don't give up on yourself. Even if other people do.

"Hi Everyone,

I've been tagged in a lot of comments about disappointment concerning the repeat Bahamut raid. I apologize for not responding right away. (I've been traveling.)

I know for veteran players, this week is not meeting your expectations, but I'd like to assure you that May won't be a disappointing month. Here's why:

* Something that everyone's been waiting for will be released on May 11th.
* We have more good bundles on the way. :D
* New stuff is coming. (I have to be vague here, sorry.)

We are still working on getting the right balance between providing challenging content for the veteran players without scaring off the newer players. In the meantime, please continue to voice your thoughts on Reddit because I do cite my sources when I report feedback to the team.

And just as a reminder, if you have any questions you'd like to submit for the Q&A on the FFBE Updates Videos, post your question in the comments of the most recent Updates video on the [Official FFBE YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDxUqVaLo7D5FjuOhrCPsFA). This is part of how we select questions for the videos.

Thank you!

"I got kind of a ‚Äúfather meeting his daughter‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äù vibe during Guardian scene with Thanos in Nowhere. He knew he had total control over the situation, and when he held Gamora hostage, he decided to toy with and test Starlord by baiting him to shoot her. 

Through the whole movie, Thanos keeps bringing up his willingness to sacrifice what he loves and make the difficult choices in order to accomplish what he believes is right. He also puts people in similar situations, holding their Thor in front of Loki, holding Nebula in front of Gamora, holding Tony in front of Strange. From Thanos‚Äô point of view, all of them fail to sacrifice another for the greater good. Except for Starlord.

When Peter pulls the trigger and the bubbles come, out he proved to Thanos that he‚Äôs willing to sacrifice others for the greater good. He then says ‚ÄúI like him.‚Äù not because he‚Äôs a sadistic psychopath who wants his daughter dead and is amused by Peter‚Äôs helplessness, but because he found a quality he respects and shares with his daughter‚Äôs boyfriend.

"As you all likely know, reddit is in the process of rolling out it's redesign. As you also may know, it is lacking features, specifically but not limited to CSS,that classic reddit provided to communities. These missing features are what provided us with the ability to create an identity for our communities, and allowed us to provide a richness that, in our opinion, improved the over all user experience and made this place feel like home. We had been promised that these features would not be lost in the effort to make styling easier for less technical moderation teams. We had been told '*We aren't going to leave you out to dry and we want to support as much customization as possible with the structured styles.*' 

The backtracking on this is a slap to all moderation teams and the efforts they put in to create these unique and wonderful places. Reducing functionality and configurability to the lowest common denominator is the not the right answer.

Why does it matter, you may ask? 

* Do you like RES and toolbox? Too bad, they aren't supported.
* Did you like the new Game Day threads this year? Those are no more. API support has been removed. 
* Do you like being able to filter to get rid of all those dogs and babies in jerseys, based on link flair? Too bad. You're going to have to see each and every one, every time you come here. 
* Sidebar bets with /r/seahawks? Nope. 
* That banner at the top that has useful links to the other team subs? Gone. 
* The big yellow bar that directs you to game threads, free agency hubs, and other important things? that doesn't fit the mold, sorry. 
* Your flair? Instead of it being easy to add/remove/modify, their new system is clunky to set up, lacking spritesheets completely without CSS. 
 * This turns minutes of work into hours and disincentivizes mods from putting in work to better a sub. All of this so a few 'less technically minded' moderations teams don't feel left out or overwhelmed by the 'complexity' of stylesheets and CSS. 

On top of this, reddit has now started pushing features without asking for feedback or a willingness to work with the teams that will be using these features. For instance, they are actively pushing out a 3^rd party chat (that will route your information through *their* servers). This has almost no moderation tools built into it and therefore requires 24/7 moderation because it does not save any text after 24 hours and reports do not go to moderators. Admin expects us to entirely pick up the slack of watching it. While it currently sits as opt-in, reddit has shown that opt-in usually means delayed rollout without tools.

All of this comes when reddit is doing less and less to support moderators. When we have trolls, it can take a minimum of three days to get admin to help enact their measures. Sometimes it can take weeks. Often, no reply is ever received and we just have to guess that we‚Äôve gotten help from above. Or we haven‚Äôt.

Earlier this week, /r/nfl removed it's style in protest of these broken promises and the general lack of communication and willingness to work with the scores of *unpaid* volunteers that allow this site to run smoothly on a daily basis. Today we are doing the same as a reminder of what these features can do for you and what you are at risk of losing.

If you are not a fan of the change, please head to /r/redesign and voice your concerns. You can also [message /r/reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/reddit.com&subject=My+Thoughts+on+the+redesign) and speak directly to them.

Hello fellow Tenno and probable DE staff. My name is Jerry, my IGN being jerry007x. I have been playing this game, for over 3 years now, and I have got to say that I am very impressed; by how much time and effort DE has put into their game. Well done DE, you have earned my respect as one of the best videogame developers of the recent years.

However, DE, that doesn't mean that you can go around and start insulting me, and my way to play the game. I admit, I don't like using Bows, Sniper Rifles, or Regular Rifles, as they do take a bit more skill to aim. Shotguns are my personal favorite, as I can run and gun with it, without needing the skill of aiming. But that doesn't mean you should go around and harass me about my preferences and skill! From such a respected developer, DE has really hit the low blow with this one, and with me. I cannot sit here and take this terrible insult!

DE, from now on, you have lost my complete respect and any future Platinum purchases from me. I still can't believe I bought that $20 Tenno-con ticket, right before my assault! I demand a well written and formated apology DE. But I can also take free platinum. Platinum is always great.

-Sincerely, Jerry. The man who can't ""aim""

"Freshman year of college my flatmate used to host loud, wild parties in her room that lasted most of the night. This usually wouldn‚Äôt bother me much‚Äîexcept for that fact anytime I had music on, even if it was just playing softly during the afternoon, she would text me and ask me to ‚Äúplease turn that down:)‚Äù

One night I ask her if she could please not have people over since I had a big final early the next morning. She agreed, but then a few hours later music started blaring from her room and it was clear she was having another party.

By 4 a.m. I‚Äôve texted her multiple times begging her to please turn it down but she turned it a bit louder after every text. I get up to use the restroom and when I‚Äôm washing my hands I hear a ton of giggling and people whispering ‚Äúdo it, do it‚Äù as a drunken frat guy stumbles into the bathroom.

He walks in, starts twirling a piece of my hair and says ‚ÄúHey sexy, how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù I‚Äôm already pissed off and tired beyond belief and I ask him multiple times to get out of the restroom‚Äî I can‚Äôt lock him out either since the restroom doors only lock from the outside since 2 dorm rooms share one toilet. He tells me he won‚Äôt leave until I ‚Äúprove that I‚Äôm fun, because I have a reputation for being lame‚Äù I shout at him to leave now and he finally goes back into my flatmate‚Äôs room and I hear my flatmate laughing as he exclaims ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, she IS a bitch!‚Äù¬†

This finally sends me over the edge and I text my flatmate telling her I‚Äôll call security if she doesn‚Äôt be quiet. She texts me back saying ‚Äúoops sorry hun, didn‚Äôt mean to be so loud, have fun peeing!!‚Äù I decided to take her advice and peed all over her toothbrush.¬†

The next morning I walk in at the time she always brushes her teeth. I wait for her to finish brushing and she finally looks over at me and apologizes for the guy in the bathroom saying ‚Äúshe hardly knows him and he turned out to be such an asshole.‚Äù

I replied ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right he is an asshole. I think he drunkenly peed on your toothbrush actually‚Äù She literally starts screaming and I dashed out for my final.

"This is a long one, but the woman in the story became a choosing beggar twice in one conversation, so hopefully worth a read.

I used to have a side job as a caretaker for a  rental home. I did the yard work (weekly mowing, gardening) and looked after the home itself. The yard was in bad shape when I first started and took hours and hours every weekend, but I needed the extra cash, even if it meant putting up with the owner.  To vastly simplify, the woman was extremely unresponsive at best and often unreasonable, and she was very much into the ""you're just the help"" entitlement.  She treated me like dirt and wouldn't listen to suggestions or answer questions, so working with her was not easy.

Case in point: a storm destroyed all of the yards in the area. She'd asked me to let her know about damages, even if she usually didn't reply, so I emailed her about the plants and let her know I planned to cut them back. I do this to my own plants every year, and they're gorgeous. She flipped out on me, insisted it would kill the plants that were already half dead, and told me just to leave them be. Fine, whatever, not my yard...but when she came by a few months later, she flipped out again because her plants were still struggling, and mine, which had been cut back, were in full bloom.  She accused me of slacking and warned me never to do it again. 

This sort of thing happened constantly. 

Also, and this one is actually relevant to this post, she didn't like how I mowed her lawn. Her yard isn't at all level, and over the years, it's sloped horribly and has been overtaken by this awful local grass that lifts up every time it rains. This makes mowing a nightmare, and she didn't like the fact that I adjusted the mower to accommodate the lumps. She wanted me to make it even, but if I'd done that, half her grass would have been taken out at the roots and died. I finally did it once, just to shut her up, and sure enough, her grass died. No acknowledgement, of course,  but she mostly stopped complaining after that.

Anyway, fast forward a year, and I'm moving a few towns over. I'd already decided not to continue as a caretaker, because she really wasn't paying me enough for the amount of work or the crazy, and I'd heard through the small town gossip mill that she planned to have friends move in and take care of the place for her anyway. Free rent in exchange for a bit of yard work is a great deal, except she waited until the friends were literally carrying their things inside to tell me I was fired. (She made up some super obvious lie to justify the sudden firing, but whatever.)

...and here's where the begging came in. She'd come to my house to fire me, and in almost the same breath, said, ""I heard you're moving. Are you giving away any beds? Not cheap ones. I want real wood.""

You mean beds that cost at least $1,000 or more in the area, and judging by your phrasing, you want one for free? Also...did you forget that you just fired me? 

I said I didn't (I totally did. Sold  three solid oak beds after she left.) She changed the subject, but a second later, she sweetly informed me that the friends moving into her place would be taking care of the yard but didn't have a lawn mower or hedge trimmers (I had always used my own). She was sure I wouldn't mind mowing it for them every few weeks, just so they wouldn't have to buy one. Only I had to do it properly this time and cut it evenly across.  

She became quite huffy after I told her I wasn't able to do that.  I haven't heard from her since, though I take great, petty pleasure in the fact that her lawn not only hasn't been mowed, but the grass and plants are all dead from zero care, and if she comes back to anything green, it'll only be from the weeds that have taken over her house. 

TL:DR Boss fires me from caretaking job, then asks for free furniture and lawn care.

"I'm surprised to learn that a lot of people didn't know this, reddit and in-game. Now that people are talking about the recent PTR Ana buff, I think it's important to point this out.

Ana's scoped shot option-select to pierce through healing hitbox.

What's healing hitbox? Your allies each has a ""true"" hitbox (closely approximate their character model), and a healing hitbox (significantly larger).

Your unscoped shot always use true hitbox for enemies, and healing hitbox for ally.

Your scoped shot however, is more complicated. It first calculate if your shot would hit anything at all if only true hitboxes are used. If your shot do in fact will hit something, then it use true hitbox. If your shot completely miss everything, then it calculates again using your allies' healing hitbox, which is larger.

What's the effect? If you are trying to aim at something, but your shot would come too close to an ally that it would hit their healing hitbox, then use scope mode. Assuming your aim is accurate, your shot will pierce through that healing hitbox to hit what you want. And if you're not accurate, it will hit that ally instead so the shot won't be completely wasted.

"I was 13 and barely knew how to handle washing my face each morning, much less staring down the task of watching you die in front of me every day, right there in the living room. 

I'm pretty sure my mom contacted the school, I was a depressive mess. My teachers went out of their way to be accommodating. I remember one day the wrestling team you used to coach gathered up all the school work I had missed and brought it to me when they came to visit you. I wasn't on the wrestling team, in barely knew them. but they loved you.

Each morning I locked myself further away in the basement. I slept away the grief. I missed out on your final lucid moments because I couldn't emotionally cope with watching you die. I gained 80lbs. I ruined my body to match my mind.

I remember when friends would come to visit. The smile. I put on was so disingenuous. I can see it in pictures. It's not the same smile I smile now.

You were the only father I ever knew, but I had trouble letting myself accept that. I wasn't feeling real pain. Not like other people who lost biological parents. You were only a grandparent, so what I was feeling wasn't legitimate. It only made it worse.

Finally when what made you *you* was gone, but your body was still hanging around, they all forced me to face you. I hated it. I hated seeing what this invisible disease had done to my big strong buppa. You shrank to half your size, your skin grayed and your hair went white. You were a mockery of the man I loved and I hated seeing what was left. I hated hugging that husk and crying into its shoulder, being the last time I'd ever be near you.

There's no resolution to this. Your cancer really fucked up what could have been a great and cherished relationship as I grew up. I will always be grateful for what we had, what you gave to me. But I'll always be bitter about what we have missed out on; what I missed out on giving to you, what I missed out on showing you.

I never called you Dad when you were alive. My young mind still had hope my real father would change his tune and accept me. But here we are 15 years later and that's never changed.

"I'll start by saying I'm from the UK. Back when I was 18, I had a little corner shop on my street, that had a lot of regulars and we all knew each other to have a quick friendly chat with. It just so happened I knew the¬†family who owned the shop. I also went school with their youngest son. The mum, dad and 2 older brothers worked at the shop, the youngest brother I went school with didn't work there.


Oldest brother - ON

Genius¬†brother¬† -GB

Youngest¬†brother¬†- YB


I was in there most days buying bits and became a regular, so when it came to buying alcohol or cigarettes the parents would just serve me without asking for ID as they knew I was old enough. The¬†family are lovely people, it was just GB. He had a massive chip on his shoulder and thought he was better than everyone else.


The YB had seen me in the shop one day, commented to GB who had just served me, that we was in the same year together. Me and the YB had a quick catch up and off I went.¬†

Over the next few weeks when I would pop in, GB would stand there eyeing me up¬†when¬†I would buy alcohol or cigarettes. He would ask his Mum or Dad are they not going to ID me, and they'd laugh him off and tell him they know I'm old enough. ¬†I didn't think much of his comments at the time, because the government was pushing ¬†stricter ID rules (such as¬†think 25)

Now and again GB would attempt conversation with Me, but it was strange. Stuff like ""you getting excited for your 18th?"" Or ""When's your 18th"" each time he would say that I would explain I'm already 18. One time he told me ""he knows the truth about my age"" ¬†I ended asking him what does¬†he mean


GB-¬†I know you're not old enough to buy¬†cigs¬†or beer¬†

Me - ... But I am. I'm 18.

GB - You was in my YB year at school?¬†

Me - I was.

GB-¬†Exactly and YB is only 17. So you are aswell.¬†

It makes sense now why this fool was telling his family to ID me and asking for my DOB.

Me - No. I turned 18 a few months back,¬†

GB - YB is 17, so you are aswell. Its simple, my mum and dad go away soon and I'm running the shop so I won't serve you in here again until you show me it isn't a fake ID.¬†


I was annoyed¬†leaving the shop, I could have shown him my ID again but I was being stubborn, and knowing what GB is like I knew he would not hand it back over because he was that convinced I was 17.¬†

I began timing to go into the shop when OB was serving, but GB busted me getting served and informed OB not to serve me again until I show GB my ID. OB told him that they've all seen my ID and I was in YB year. GB fired back ""yeah she was! And YB is only 17! She's using a fake ID""

You could see the confusion on OB face at GBs¬†logic of why I¬†must be¬†17. OB shook his head and mouthed it's OK.

I was getting fed up of GB and his little vendetta against me. That incident was the last straw, he had purposefully embarrassed me in the shop where other people¬†watched on. I needed to do something about it.¬†

I went in one day when I knew it would be busy and when GB would be in the shop. Pottering round the shop I picked up a loaf of bread and a milk. Placing them on the counter, I smiled at OB. I slightly stepped to the side, so it was visible to people behind me what I had placed down. I acted like I was looking at the cigarettes.

Sure enough, GB speeds to the counter and tells OB he'll serve me. GB has this shit eating grin like he's finally caught me out. I'm still eyeing up the cigarette counter and a few people are behind me waiting.¬†

GB- ID please¬†

Me-¬†What?¬†

GB-¬†ID or I won't serve you.¬†

I begin to smile now, and GB shit eating grin is slowly turning into confusion.

Responding loudly, so the people behind me can hear clearly

Me- Didn't realise you needed ID to buy bread and milk.¬†

GB is silent. He realises I wasn't planning on buying cigs, I had just set him up¬†too look¬†a fool in front of the shop Like he had done with me.¬†

Another regular who was behind me goes¬†

""Jesus, I Didn't realise the government was cracking down that much with stuff you need an ID for"" ¬†

OB is grinning, whilst GB looks embarrassed and tells OB to serve me whilst he quickly retreated to the back of the store. As OB is tilling my items up another person pops up with ""Hey, OB I'm buying cat food. Will I need ID or...?""

I made a point after that, if GB was serving me regardless of whether it was age restricted products to casually say out loud¬†

""Do you need my ID for this?""¬†

"[CBC Article](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/william-lynskey-1.4571892)

Willam Lynskey's remains have been found in Banff National Park, in the Lake Minnewanka area of the park after a year of being missing. The 21 year old was reported missing by family in Vancouver, BC after he did not respond to texts or return home, in April 2017. He was originally from Whistler BC, but was in Vancouver attending BCIT.

In the subsequent investigation it had been found he had boarded a Greyhound bus destined for Edmonton, Alberta. It was determined he had stayed the night in Edmonton at a hotel room. 

What remains unclear is how he made his way to Banff, Alberta. Banff is a mountain town on the Alberta side of the Rocky Mountains and is located near Banff National Park. It is about a 4 hour journey from Edmonton, and as he took the Greyhound from BC to Alberta, it is unknown how he made the trek to Banff from Edmonton, and why.

His ID was found by a maitenence worker in between some couch cushions in Banff's Cascade Plaza mall. This was reportedly sometime in the fall of 2017 which means he could have gone from Edmonton to Banff of his own free will, and was alive for sometime after being reported missing in BC in April 2017.

What frustrated the investigation is that the ID was not handed over to police until sometime in March 2018. The worker had apparently posted on social media about the found ID, but there was a disconnect where investigators were not made aware of its discovery.

It has been reported a hiker found his remains in Lake Minnewanka which is about 5km north of the Banff townsite on April 25, 2018 almost a year after he was reported missing. 

I don't want to speculate about his death, but from what can be gleaned from reports and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance, it does not look like there is any foul play involved.",False,0,False,"[RESOLVED] BC Man William Lynskey has been found deceased in Banff National Park in Alberta","r/UnresolvedMysteries",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gwfc7",False,"dark","public",309,"self.UnresolvedMysteries","",False,False,False,309,"self",False,"self",True,"richtext",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2wvvc","8gwfc7",0,20,True,"/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/8gwfc7/resolved_bc_man_william_lynskey_has_been_found/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/8gwfc7/resolved_bc_man_william_lynskey_has_been_found/",381489,False,False,2048,"best"

"Ryan pulled his sword out of the last of the Helhests, sucking in a pained breath as he did. Blood ran from a dozen shallow cuts, and his shirt had been burned away, revealing flesh marked with blisters from their burning breath. He tried not to think about how bad the injuries would have been if not for Athena‚Äôs reinforcements. He looked over to Crystal, who gave him her best smile, but the circles under her eyes and unsteady gait would have showed she was feeling the fight as badly as he was, if that hadn‚Äôt been given away by how matted her hair was, or her skin burned raw by the earlier steam. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the first round done and gone, yeah? Guess we came out alright in the end.‚Äù

Ryan shook his head. ‚ÄúThe others still fighting?‚Äù 

Crystal wove a quick lens in the air and peered into it, and Ryan noticed that she put her sword into the ground, resting on the pommel as she did for balance. ‚ÄúLooks like they just wrapped up too. Bit of a hike to get back, love. May need to catch their breaths, they‚Äôre as badly banged up as we are.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamnit,‚Äù Ryan muttered, getting a raised eyebrow out of Crystal for the curse. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre outmatched, Crystal. That was just an exploratory force, the Lindworm and twenty riders. Moloch‚Äôs got a few more dragons and dozens more riders than that, not counting whatever other monsters he‚Äôs called up, and we barely won against this! And the Olympians are completely holed up in there. I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶I‚Äôm worried they won‚Äôt come out.‚Äù

Crystal motioned for him to walk away from the battlefield with her, which Ryan appreciated. It helped to get even just a bit of distance between the stench of death. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they will, love. I think we have to assume we‚Äôre on our own here.‚Äù

Ryan reached up to rub his temple, where a headache was forming. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt get help, we‚Äôre going to lose!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong, love. We‚Äôre completely, utterly buggered, no two ways about it.‚Äù

Silence fell, and Ryan looked at her for a couple moments, his face full of expectation. ‚ÄúUh, Crystal. This is usually the part where you give me something we can work with, some kind of reassurance?‚Äù

Crystal shrugged, but her smile didn‚Äôt waiver. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the thing. I don‚Äôt have anything like that for you. Wish I could say I did.‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs face began to fall, but she continued, ‚ÄúThen again, I didn‚Äôt have any idea how we were supposed to be Enki when he was juiced up. Looking at that fight, I would have said the same thing if you‚Äôd asked.‚Äù

Ryan felt his mouth fall open in shock. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶I mean, you seemed so calm during that fight. Like we had it the entire time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd am I acting any differently now?‚Äù she asked, quirking an eyebrow as she did. Ryan shook his head. ‚ÄúThere you go then.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why‚Äôs this feel so much worse, Crystal? I was worried then, scared out of my damn mind, but it didn‚Äôt feel anywhere near this hopeless.‚Äù

Crystal reached out to put a hand on his shoulder, carefully placing it on unburned skin. ‚ÄúBecause, love, this time you know more. You know your strength and the rest of our strength. You know what you can and can‚Äôt do, and right know everything you know is telling you that you can‚Äôt beat this. It‚Äôs telling you that we‚Äôre facing against impossible odds, and that at the end of the day we‚Äôre going to fail, yeah?‚Äù Ryan grimaced as he nodded. ‚ÄúWell, bollocks to that. We‚Äôve done the impossible before, and you barely knew what you were doing! Not only that, we did it with grace and style and some cheeky jokes about the whole thing. So stop thinking it‚Äôs impossible, because we‚Äôve already dealt with that word before, and we will pull it off again, yeah?‚Äù

Ryan felt a smile form on his face. ‚ÄúOkay, yeah. We‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood lad.‚Äù She took her hand off his shoulder and swung the lens to survey Moloch‚Äôs army. After a couple minutes of surveying it, she let out a hiss of air in surprise. ‚ÄúOh, and here‚Äôs some good news, love! Well, also some bad news. I found your sister.‚Äù  

She stepped aside as Ryan rushed over to look. Isabel was on her knees, in chains. Moloch was talking to her, and nearby Uriel stood with her arms crossed, her face impassive. ‚ÄúOh that son of a bitch. Arthur sold us out.‚Äù

Crystal‚Äôs voice was still casual, ‚ÄúSeems like it. Explains how she vanished so utterly, yeah? Angels can go places our staging areas don‚Äôt reach. Just whisked her away.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamnit. Doesn‚Äôt this violate our agreement?‚Äù Ryan asked, clenching and unclenching his fists. ‚ÄúHow can he possibly give her a nanoverse now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou made a deal with the King of Hell?‚Äù Crystal asked, and Ryan turned to face her. 

‚ÄúYeah. To find Isabel a nanoverse. Wanted to make sure ‚Äì I mean, had to make sure she survived all this.‚Äù

Crystal gave him an understanding nod. ‚ÄúThen she‚Äôs probably semi\-safe right now. I mean, did anything in the agreement specify that you had to still be alive when he gave it to her? Or that she had to retain her freedom after getting one?‚Äù

If Ryan had been less exhausted, he might have lashed out with a bolt of lightning or something similar out of sheer frustration. ‚ÄúNo. Nothing‚Ä¶damnit, he could probably technically fulfill it by having Uriel put it in her hand and then cutting her head off.‚Äù Nausea that had nothing to do with his injuries was washing over him. ‚ÄúI gave him the knife, turned my back to him, and said ‚Äòoh no I hope you don‚Äôt stab me with that knife.‚Äô‚Äù 

‚ÄúHey, Ryan.‚Äù Crystal motioned in his face to draw his attention away from his fears. ‚ÄúPulling off the impossible again, right? Stop bloody wallowing in what could go wrong, focus on how we‚Äôre going to get it to go right.‚Äù

Ryan took a few deep breaths. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said, rubbing his face as he did. ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right. We‚Äôre going to beat Moloch, we‚Äôre going to save my sister, and then we‚Äôre going to pop over to Hell and kick Arthur‚Äôs ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit.‚Äù At that moment, the others crested the hill. Athena and Anansi were leaning on each other for support, and Dianmu was using her glaive as a walking stick. 

‚ÄúYou all alright?‚Äù Ryan asked. Nods of affirmation replied, although Athena‚Äôs seemed more sincere than the other two‚Äôs. 

‚ÄúWe need rest,‚Äù Dianmu added, pointing back at the fortress Crystal and her had constructed. ‚ÄúWe should fortify that as strongly as possible, and then take care of our Hungers.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed,‚Äù Ryan said, tearing himself away from the lens completely. *You‚Äôre no good to Isabel if you get yourself killed,* he reminded himself.  ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs still a risk while we‚Äôre resting.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can keep watch.‚Äù Ryan jumped at the voice coming from one of the drones. With everything going on, he‚Äôd forgotten that Resheph had been watching the whole thing from behind the screens. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve gotten the controls for these things down, and I‚Äôve got plenty of energy to spare.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Ryan said. Knowing they had someone covering them was the final shove to push him over the edge as his legs started to sag, and he used his sword to support his weight the way Crystal had as the weight of his injuries and exhaustion began to settle into his bone. There were other Hungers to tend to, but right now what he needed sleep. ‚ÄúEveryone able to make the walk?‚Äù

Weary nods all around. They headed back to the fortress to sleep, Ryan‚Äôs tired brain turning over and over as they did, trying to find some solution to the impossible fight ahead.",False,0,False,"Strange Cosmology part 87","r/Hydrael_Writes",False,"",0,"","",False,"t3_8gy7q5",False,"dark","restricted",94,"self.Hydrael_Writes","",False,False,False,94,"self",False,True,"text","","text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"richtext",False,"t5_3ke9z","8gy7q5",0,10,True,"/r/Hydrael_Writes/comments/8gy7q5/strange_cosmology_part_87/","",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrael_Writes/comments/8gy7q5/strange_cosmology_part_87/",14069,False,False,2048,"best"

"> ""Give us 'The Night That Ended,' singer,"" he bellowed. ""The bride will like that one, I know. **Or sing to us of brave young Danny Flint and make us weep.**""

As I'm sure most of us know, Danny Flint was a girl who pretended to join the Night's Watch. A song about a girl who pretended to be somebody she was not, and was raped as a result. That core message is exactly what happens to Jeyne - she pretended to be somebody else, and Ramsay raped her.

It's not a coincidence that he suggested this song. In that same chapter, he also requests that the bard sing 'The Rat Cook', a song about a man who baked someone else's sons into pies. This is of course meant to reflect how Wyman had the Freys baked into pies. So, if one song carries a secret meaning, why not another? 

It could be a jab at the Boltons, at Jeyne herself, or both. I doubt Wyman is too impressed about the fact that the steward's girl is impersonating the daughter of his former liege lord, and in doing so helping to hand the North to the Boltons on a silver platter.

It could be his way of saying to Jeyne: ""You think you're going to get what you want, but you're soon going to regret it"" (keep in mind he likely isn't fully aware of her reasons for doing this.)

---

Edit: An idea just occurred to me. It's worth noting that Arya being fake might not necessarily be something he knows 100% for sure. And I believe that's the significance behind suggesting 'The Night That Ended.' If Arya is fake, she will be too focused on the song about Danny Flint, as that hits closer to home and was intended to be a jab at her current situation.

But in the off-chance that she is real, then 'The Night That Ended' is meant to comfort her by saying that even the darkest times will come to an end, and things will get better.",False,0,False,"(Spoilers ADWD) Wyman Manderly knows about Arya...","r/asoiaf",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gvzn7",False,"dark","public",372,"self.asoiaf","",False,False,False,372,"self",1525407134.0,True,"richtext",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2r2o9","8gvzn7",0,55,True,"/r/asoiaf/comments/8gvzn7/spoilers_adwd_wyman_manderly_knows_about_arya/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/8gvzn7/spoilers_adwd_wyman_manderly_knows_about_arya/",427686,False,False,2048,"best"
"Credit Karma says the account was opened Jan 2 of this year, but I never received anything in the mail or any phone calls from a new collections agency in the past 6 months-1 year. The description on Credit Karma says it was for an ER physician.

This could be related to a workers comp claim back in summer 2016. Workers comp covered one ER bill, but I was still on the hook for $700 that I eventually sent to my insurance when a collections agency was on my tail for it in 2017. This amount doesn't match the amount reported on Credit Karma from this agency, but it could be a reason why the account was 96% paid off on the report. It says I owe the agency $51 now. That same year, I also had a visit to a mental ward for a week, but insurance notified me that the stay was covered and I never saw a bill for it.

My question is how I should approach this. Do I just call the company listed on my report? I can't pull a full report from annualcreditreport.com until July of this year. Can I still make them validate this debt even though its been opened and mostly paid off for 4 months? Or should I just dispute this and wait to hear back?

"Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äì there‚Äôs an appeal to breaking the rules. 

Maybe we‚Äôve heard them one too many times from teachers or other redditors who are *just a bit too snippy* about them. Perhaps we see them as too much trouble to be worthwhile. And, of course, we‚Äôre all writing that one piece of work that transcends the bounds of rules if we‚Äôre being candid‚Ä¶ Right?!

There are plenty of ‚Äúmade to be broken‚Äù rules out there, and I wouldn‚Äôt suggest that anyone avoid trying. It can be fun and beneficial to the final product. Before you do, however, really think about the rule first. To say we should know the rules before we break them sounds clich√© - That‚Äôs only because **good advice is often repeated**.

----------------

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts about how great rule breaking is and, not to call anyone out, a lot of them seem like bad advice. Some examples:

* ~~**Stop using the word ‚Äòsaid‚Äô when there are so many other words you can use.**~~ I feel like there‚Äôs near universal agreement that the ‚Äòsaid‚Äô tag is essentially invisible to readers, while the alternatives are often not.

* ~~**Ignore grammar if your sentences (seem) more interesting without it.**~~ Grammar is crucial to ensuring someone else interprets your writing correctly ‚Äì trying to duck grammar in the name of creativity is going to cause your work to suffer. It should be noted that some correctly point out that grammar and style are not the same, which is true. Play with style... Don't F with grammar.

* ~~**Adverbs are your friend, and spice up your writing.**~~ Adverbs spice things up like salt spices up food. Great in moderation, gives people a heart attack when overdone.

Before you jump on board with breaking these or other rules, seriously pause and think about the rule. 

* Why is it considered a rule in the first place? 
* How could my writing be better by maintaining the rule? 
* Will breaking it cause my reader to misinterpret my writing?
* Will breaking it pull my reader out of the immersive experience of my work?

--------

I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶ because this is always the reply I see from rule-breakers‚Ä¶ *‚ÄúBut what about Stephen King, or JK Rowling, or Tolkien did they did this or this or that?‚Äù* But nothing ‚Äì outliers are outliers. For every King/Rowling/Tolkien there are scores of writers who had a great novel that died in a slush pile because the writer didn't think the rules applied to them.

If you want to attract an audience, don‚Äôt bank on becoming the next one-in-a-million shot‚Ä¶ because that necessarily means it won‚Äôt work 999,999 other times. That‚Äôs a pretty big collection of trunked novels! 

Bank on what works most consistently because, let‚Äôs face it, the odds are stacked against us all anyway.

"## **Hey everyone!**

As of this evening, we are implementing a new addition to /u/nautbot that will be targeting affiliate and referral links on /r/Gundeals.

When a referral or affiliate code is found in a submitted URL, /u/nautbot will remove the post, and notify the submitter.  In order to minimize disruption to our genuine contributors, /u/nautbot will [include a resubmit link](https://i.imgur.com/ZLHFFYu.png) in the removal notice, [pre-populating a new submission form](https://i.imgur.com/055isd8.png) with the title from the removed submission and a clean URL, free of affiliate and referral arguments.  That is, only two clicks to resubmit your post!

As time goes on, we'll be fine tuning /u/nautbot's heuristics - the current rule set has been tested on about 6,000 historical posts without many issues, but there's always the off chance of a false positive due to something we didn't anticipate.  If you have any issues with a post that gets removed or the resubmit link the bot provides, just [send a message to modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgundeals).

### **What's so bad about affiliate links?**

In short, profit.  The sole intent of affiliate marketers is to put their links in front of as many people as possible, as they get a small cut from each conversion.  They don't care about the purpose of a community like /r/Gundeals, where the goal is sharing actual deals.  They just want clicks and conversions, and will spam any and every platform them can find to get them.  In addition, many affiliate marketing programs also operate referral programs where affiliates make more money by getting additional affiliates to work underneath them - literally a multi-level marketing a.k.a. pyramid scheme.  The result is a constantly growing army of spammers saturating the same platforms.

Since the recent banning and reinstatement of /r/Gundeals, it seems the publicity has exposed this community to many affiliate marketers.  We went from an average of about 27 submissions per day before the ban, to over 100 per day immediately after.  Many of you may have noticed the difference in /r/Gundeals content in the first week or two back, including the prevalence on ""non deal"" posts - this is a result of affiliate marketing, which we've been combating.",False,0,False,"5/3/2018 - RIP Affiliate Marketing","r/gundeals",False,0,0,"","no_ads",False,"t3_8gv9qi",False,"dark","public",511,"self.gundeals","",False,False,False,511,"self",1525396282.0,"self",True,"text",0,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2rq8n","8gv9qi",0,108,False,"/r/gundeals/comments/8gv9qi/532018_rip_affiliate_marketing/","no_ads",True,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gundeals/comments/8gv9qi/532018_rip_affiliate_marketing/",144989,False,False,2048,"best"

"This CMV is based on this [recent article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/goldman-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model.html). If you don't feel like reading the whole thing, basically a Goldman Sachs analyst wrote this in a memo regarding potential ""one-shot cures"". He says, ""While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow.""  

This is just one guy, and one memo, but it seems that he is 100% correct: Premise 1: Revenue sustains company X. Premise 2: Need for treatment drives revenue for company X. Premise 3: Cure Y eliminates need for treatment. Conclusion: Cure Y kills company X.  

Based on that argument, can we reasonably say that company X sees cure Y as an existential threat to their business, and thus a threat to the financial well-being of the stakeholders?  

If an investor in company X wants to see a return, then the investor would like to see revenue sustained and growing, right?  

So company X, and it's millions of stakeholders want to see a return, all of their priorities are in the treatment and in opposition to the cure.  

EDIT: I anticipate some people will point out that he said ""sustain cash-flow"", and not necessarily return on investor capital. True, but if the company has cured a disease, and it ""carries tremendous value for patients and society"" as he pointed out, then that ""tremendous"" value should far outweigh the cost of the company losing ""sustained cash-flow"" from the treatment.

"I knew this table was going to be a lot as soon as I started taking their orders. Asked to be seated in the cozier back room, lots of changes to menu items - alright, some people have specific tastes, that's fine. I'll just work extra hard to make sure they have a good experience, since they probably have a hard time eating out if they're picky. I leave detailed notes for the cook (who nails it), run them their food, ask if I can get them anything else, and he says no, they're all good. Great. 

I start bussing the table right next to them just as another table walks in, so I stop bussing to seat them in the front room and take their order (we don't have any other servers, and we've never had a host/hostess or a busser, so I'm literally doing everything except cooking). The new table orders quickly, I send it through, and am on my way back to the first table to double check to see if they liked their food. It's been 3-5 mins tops since I left the table next to them. As I'm on the way back across the restaurant, the phone rings. I pick up, thinking I'll just quickly take this reservation and ask the table how they like their food in a sec.

It's the dude at the first table. He's ""been waiting like 27 minutes for someone to come by"" - he needs more lemons for his fish. I cut some fresh ones and bring half a lemon's worth of slices to his table. He says he needs more. ""Of course, sir, right away,"" and I bring the other half of the lemon sliced. He needs even more. I cut up another lemon and bring the whole thing to his table. Run the food to the nice couple. Check in a few more times with the picky table. Everything is fine.

Dude leaves me $10 on a $300 tab with a note that says ""Worse ever.""

"This just happened. I just finished finals for university and got screwed over. It started in my Computer Science class a couple months before today. Projects 3 and 4 were to be group projects. We were assigned a teammate from the class. My teammate, we'll call him Sam, and I decided we'd meet up and work on the project. After discussing what we wanted to do we found the easiest way would be to work remotely and text each other as we both have very busy schedules.

Flash forward to a week before its due, and Sam has done nothing. I started working on it and was waiting for him to collaborate. He did not. At this point I said fuck it, and starting working on the project. I got 90% of it done in 3 days, and left the other 10% to him. He kept saying how sorry he was and that he was busy. Ok, I get it, I'm busy too, you could have put more effort in, but our peer evals will reflect that. Well, he does the last 10%, but not correctly, so I go back in and finish it and submit it, thinking I won't have to deal with him again. Wrong.

The next week we had an exam. Exams in this class had in in class portion, and an online coding portion, each worth abut 50% of the total exam grade. Online portions were released a few days before and were due before midnight exam day. Well, at 7pm on exam day, I got a text from Sam asking to send an online portion, I ignored it, and he kept texting. It was like he felt entitled to getting my exam. I wasn't about to fail this test or give a leech blood, but this reaaallly pissed me off.

Then we had project 4 assigned. It was essentially an extension of project 3, so we would have the same groups. This project was much harder, and way more time consuming. Knowing Sam's work ethic last time, I came up with a plan. I did minimal work on the project up until it the week before it was due. Then I ramped it up. The day before it was due, I got a text from Sam, saying ""I'm sorry dude I was super busy with my other project, and didn't have time to work on it. Is there  anything left to do?"" 

Now, we used an online code editor that works similar to Google Docs in that you can see who is looking at the file, and where their cursor is. I had seen his periodically throughout the entire last week. He was checking on how I was doing, but not actually helping. So when he asked ""Is there anything left to do?"" My response was no. He apologized profusely (he just texted ""sorry"") and I immediately emailed the professor explaining the situation. This asshole was going down.

A couple hours later I got an email back from my prof. Just as I thought, Sam had submitted the code (each partner submitted separately) as his own. My prof was very understanding and replied with this: ""The submission Sam put up was not fully featured or particularly well working, so he did not receive much in the way of points.  I was unaware who did what, though, and as it seems to be your work his grade will reflect that. His failures are his own."" Justice served, motherfucker.

I got another text from Sam today, asking me what I got on the project. Telling him that I got an A was the most satisfying thing ever.",False,0,False,"Try to screw me over in class?

######**Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle** [Game Size: 162 MB] (free)

**Genre**: Puzzle - Offline

**tl;dr review**:

A challenging puzzle game set in the Friday the 13th universe where we move Jason around a tiled map by swiping in any direction - with the goal of killing everyone in as few moves as possible. 

With over 100 very well-design levels to dive into, the monetization focuses on incentivized ads to get a hint, a forced skippable video-ad after an entire episode of levels is completed, and iAP to unlock cosmetic weapons and the last few levels for Jason.

I had to get help finishing a level or two - if that says anything about the difficulty of the levels. One of the best puzzle games I've played!

######**Starlost** [Game Size: 251 MB] (free)

**Genre**: Sci-Fi / Top-Down / Shooter / RPG - Offline

**tl;dr review**: 

We leave our mothership in a mini vessel, destroy asteroids to fill up our cargo with resources, fly back to the mothership when under attack or to load off cargo, dock with mothership to upgrade our vessel, add drones and guns to it, and then we rinse and repeat as we play through the story mission. 

That's basically Starlost for ya'. Honestly, the story together with the gameplay and music gave me one of the best mobile sci-fi top-down shooter experiences I've had so far.

Monetization happens mostly through selling cosmetics and 'RU', which is the only in-game currency. This DOES give the devs the option to make the game impossibly difficult, forcing us to grind or pay up, but thus far, it seems the indie team has cut a nice balance between free-playability and monetization.

######**Pixel Gun 3D** [Total Game Size: 794 MB] (free)

**Genre**: Shooter / Action - Online

**tl;dr review**:

Despite being rather P2W (don't stop reading), Pixel Gun 3D is highly entertaining fast-paced shooter set in a Minecraft-like universe.

I initially thought the game would be nothing more than a Minecraft ""mod"", but beneath the surface is a wealth of maps and game modes that I've not seen in ANY other mobile shooter till date. 

So if you're looking for something fun to play with friends that doesn't take itself too seriously, Pixel Gun 3D is a good candidate (just remember that it's p2w - so don't go hardcore on it).

######**Paladins Strike** [Total Game Size: 479 MB] (free)

**Genre**: MOBA / Action - Online

**tl;dr review**: 

A casual - and refreshingly different - 5v5 moba, where the matches take between 5-10 minutes and the main ""siege"" gamemode has us rush for control of an objective in the middle of the map and subsequently safely deliver a payload to the opponent teams' base.

There's 1 more game-mode and another in development and a wealth of heroes to buy in typical moba-style, with free heroes in rotation.

The game plays very nicely, but my two main concerns are that; 1) the matchmaking is very unbalanced - I lost my first 7 matches after installing the game, and 2) the ""rune"" system, which increase our hero's main stats, which is rather P2W (upwards of 7% damage increase)!

######**Overdrive Ninja Shadow** [Total Game Size: 113 MB] (free)

**Genre**: Action / 2D - Offline

**tl;dr review**: 

While I initially found the combat in 2D Ninja-fighting 'Overdrive' too easy, the endless mode is very challenging and every new ninja we buy comes with new combo attacks, which makes the game more and more interesting the deeper you dive in. 

The game can be played offline and monetizes through iAP to buy more of the single in-game currency, and incentivized video ads to double the gold rewarded after every level.

A fun time-waster for offline train-rides that promises to add a multiplayer mode in the future too.

"Hello, 

I am from India, I've been playing fortnite since around October of last year. This is the most fun game I've played ever, so I am still playing it. The problem is, Ping is HIGH AS 200-1100.

Ping on my broadband is, 180-1100, and on mobile data Jio4G, it's ranges from 160-200. Still not good. 

So please, fortnite team, please get some servers in Asia. SEA/Indian servers. 

I literally cannot play this game without being anxious about what will happen when I will just lag in a 1v1. You see, its so annoying to play with friends. 

I've seen a lot of posts regarding this, still nothing. 

Edit : Some people just say, ""come on, it's a free game"", no, I paid for the battle pass (still it's free game, but...), I love this game

Edit 2 : my post also targets for locations which are suffering because of bad ping. It's not for India.

Edit 3 : for people saying Chinese servers will help https :// youtu. be/qI9PFEc-KhA

Edit 4 : People are getting this post the wrong way, I am not xenophobic, nor the other indian players are, i play on European servers and have made a lot of friends.

"Guards in DnD used to rarely be a threat to my players. Whether it's because my magic junkies can flee the scene of a crime in less than a minute or blast their way out with a maximized fireball, level 7+ PCs are just too scary for the conventional justice system. It starts to become the elephant in the room when a guard approaches a PC and the player tells the others, ""We could just magic missile this guy and leave"". Without massively exaggerating the level of your common city watch or giving your guards absurdly expensive gear, your options as a DM will start to dwindle. My campaigns usually don't go in a straight line, so I had to think of a solution when I told my players they could start at level 10.

Insert flaregems. Mined from the mineral-rich hills and mountains my country sat on, these gems are fuel sources for a magical flare. Oh, but they're not just any magical flare.

Oh no.

When a guard wearing a flaregem takes any damage, or speaks a code into the gem, the gem's runes will activate. It sends a magical blue flare into the sky and takes d4+10 rounds to reach its apex. Once this happens, the nearest garrison teleports the respective backup squad through to the gigantic teleportation circle projected onto the ground with a 0% chance of failure.

Backup squads range from mundane to scary:

Code: | Requisites: | Consists of:
-----|-----------|------------
Groen (backup patrol) | Default backup. Sent if no code is spoken. | Guard x20, Rider x4
Blar (reinforcements) | Magical creature/weapon/person or additional backup. | Guard x15, Mage x10, Rider x5, Sergeant x2
Neff (kill squad) | Serious criminals, clerics, deserters, high level shit. | H. Knight x6, War Mage x4, Bone Devil x2, Druid x1, Maug x3, Enlightened (Archmage) x1
Allhar (battle corps) | Unidentified/seriously dangerous. | Guard x40, Rider x10, Mage x6, Sergeant x5, Hippogriff Rider x6, Cleric (mounted on drakes) x4, Shield Guardian x1, Enlightened (Archmage) x1
Rodinn (response team) | Enemy army. | Empty the nearest garrisons
Kyrr | Agent requesting suicide. | Meteor storm centered on agent



Guards that call in a false report are immediately dismissed from duty.

This system allows guard patrols to travel in small squads with little to no fear of retribution. If even a drop of blood is spilled over a run in with the law, there is always hell to pay.

The system isn't perfect, however. I refer to the circumvention of flaregems affectionately as ""guard-tarding"". Any method of removing the flaregems from a guard, through magic or otherwise, is a lucrative yet insanely risky process that takes away the only advantage the guards have over the common bandit. Whether you dispel the runes that permeate each gem, or charm the guard into taking it off himself, the patrol immediately becomes 2 guys standing in shitty metal armor with a single sword shared between them.

There are state-run garrisons with wizards standing by to begin the teleportation process. If the wizards cannot decipher the location of the flaregem or use their high-level magic, the guards relying on them are shit out of luck. In this instance, anti-teleportation/divination magic or a tunnel deep enough underground will prevent the flaregem from receiving its reinforcements.
Finally, if the nearest garrison is completely empty, guard response time to an active flaregem is drastically increased. (d8*10 minutes)

Flaregems allow every patrol to have authority and put the PCs back in their place even when they're high level. Assuming you manage to wipe out a patrol and its ensuing backup, you bet your ass the clerics of the realm will find out who you are. Then, you get a kill squad sent after you. Nobody survives those.

"I am sure most of us have seen the [fr0zen tweet](https://twitter.com/Liquid_Fr0zen/status/988225837819486208) about it being correct to concede turn 1 in a lot of matchups to save time. Many matchups are incredibly polarizing (e.g. quest rogue vs literally everything that is not Warlock).

Below, we investigate the following - given that we have some probability P of winning the game, and winning takes W time (on average) while losing takes L time on average (in the given matchup), should we keep playing, or just concede the game. We also assume that the overall win-rate of the deck we are playing is WR, and the average game for the deck takes T time. Also let's say we have H time to play in a given session.

**We do not have infinite time - but that doesn't matter**

One key thing to realize is that fr0zen's concern is about time, yet the time we have to play actually does not matter. 

You are in a game that will take you 10 minutes to win (20% chance) or 5 minutes to lose (80% chance). You are playing a 55% win-rate deck that has average games of 10 minutes, and have 20 minutes left to play.

If you concede immediately, you expect to lose one game right now (-1) and then win 1.1 games (+0.2) in the next average 2 games for a total -0.8 outcome.

If you play the game out, your expectation for the current game is either a +1 outcome over 10 minutes (20% of the time) followed by 0.55-0.45 = 0.1 for the next 10 minutes, and -1 for the next 5 minutes and 0.15 for the next 15 minutes (80% of the time). Overall, we either get 1.1 20% of the time or -0.85 80% of the time. Our expected outcome is -0.46, so we should not concede.

Now let's say we are still in the same situation (10/20% for win or 5/80% for loss) but we have 10 hours (600 minutes to play). Going through the motions again, we are 20% to go +1 + 59x0.1 = 6.9 and 80% to go -1 + 59.5x0.1 = 4.95 for a total EV of staying in the game of 5.34. If we concede, we have EV of -1+60x0.1 = 5. So we should concede and move on.

What if we had 60,000 minutes to play?

EV_concede = -1 + 0.1x6000 = 599
EV_play = 0.2x(1+5999x0.1) + 0.8x(-1 + 5999.5x0.1) = 599.34

We should **STILL** play the game out, but the % effect on our expected value is low.

**The more time we have to play (like pro players) the more likely we are to think that conceding a game is correct, even if it is not based on our metric of expected time to climb**. Still, let's not forget that this was a player who conceded a game in HCT worlds without lethal on board.

**It is a purely emotional response to concede a game like that, and in doing that, the conceder is optimizing also for emotional reasons**. Below, we will derive the exact formula and check if there is EVER a realistic simulation where you'd like to concede to climb faster, as fr0zen was saying.

**Deriving an actual math formula**

We proceed as in the numerical example above - we are trying to maximize the number of wins-losses (i.e. the EV) of a gaming session of H hours, with the other variables as designated above.

*If we concede immediately*

Our EV is -1 + (H/T)x(2xWR-1).

*If we do not concede immediately*

Our EV is Px(+1 + (H-W)/Tx(2xWR-1)) + (1-P)(-1 + (H-L)/Tx(2xWR-1) = (2xP-1) + (H/T)x(2xWR-1) - Px(2xWR-1)xW/T - (1-P)x(2xWR - 1)xL/T

The way we isolated the terms is that we should play the game on only if (2xP)/(2xWR - 1) > PxW/T + (1-P)xL/T (assuming WR > 0.5, since otherwise you should just switch decks).

We need a bit of a simpler formula: **2/(2xWR - 1) > W/T + (1/P - 1)xL/T**

We call this reduced formula the Criterion. The criterion is independent of H, which is good, because it will expose the bias in our thinking based on the volume of games we play.

**Using the formula to see when it is acceptable to concede**

Looking at the Criterion, the Right Hand Side (RHS) is a decreasing function of P, while the LHS is a constant. For typical T1 decks, the WR will be about 0.55, making the LHS about 20. With this Eyeball Criterion (EC), we can also disregard the W/T term and say it is about 1, leaving us with an approximate criterion (AC) 20 > (1/P - 1)xL/T. Call L/T = k, we expect k to be about 1. So we have (20+k)/k> 1/P or we need P > k/(k+20). Call this the threshold win-rate below which we concede.

Below is a table of threshold win-rates, based on how long it takes to lose, below which we should concede:

k|P(k)
:--|:--
0.1|0.5%
0.2|1%
...|...
0.7|3.3%
0.8|3.8%
0.9|4.3%
1|4.8%
1.1|5.2%
...|...
3.3|14.2%
3.4|14.5%
3.5|14.9%

**Conclusion**

**You should never concede turn 1. Even the most lopsided matchups in the current or any meta I have seen are better than 15-85 for the loser**.

There are clearly situations where your threshold probability is higher than your odds of winning (e.g. Control Warrior vs Rin Warlock who has Rin-pact on 7 and it is turn 10 and they have Guldan etc). Still, those are oddly specific to a lot of matchups and usually become apparent once the game progresses fast enough.

I hope you enjoyed this write-up, and will go into your next games with the thought that you will play them out. Even the 10% matchups are not ones you should concede in the very beginning.",False,0,False,"Math in Hearthstone #4 - when is it right to concede (even on turn 1)?","r/CompetitiveHS",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gwztm",False,"dark","public",159,"self.CompetitiveHS","",False,False,False,159,"self",1525415182.0,"self",True,"richtext",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_31ns2","8gwztm",0,64,True,"/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/8gwztm/math_in_hearthstone_4_when_is_it_right_to_concede/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/8gwztm/math_in_hearthstone_4_when_is_it_right_to_concede/",89214,False,False,2048,"best"

"Some background: I'm a 26 year old dev currently living in Stockholm, Sweden. I am a dual EU and US citizen but I lived in the US from age 2 to 24 when my parents moved from Europe to California. I did my BSCS at UC Berkeley, worked for two years as a developer for a company in Palo Alto, and then moved to Sweden at age 24 to study do my MSCS at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I now work as a software engineer in Sweden.

I've seen a couple of posts on here with American devs wanting to move to Europe so I thought I would share my experience and some information about my salary.

Working in SF area
---
* Gross Annual Salary: $105000/year
* Gross Monthly Salary: $8750/year
* Monthly Taxes: $1550 Federal Income Tax + $542 Social Security + $126 Medicare + $616 California Income Tax + $87 California SDI = $2921/month
* Net Monthly Salary: $5829/month
* Tax Rate: 33.3%

Note: My US paycheck was actually biweekly but here in Sweden its monthly. I just converted the biweekly amounts to monthly amounts for easier comparison.

Working in Stockholm area
---
* Gross Monthly Salary: 53882 SEK/month ($6056/month) (note this is BEFORE payroll taxes. In Sweden it is more common to state your salary after payroll taxes but before income taxes. For example, my salary in Sweden is 41000 SEK/month which is after payroll taxes but before income taxes)
* Monthly Taxes: 10721 SEK ($1205) Federal & Communal Tax + 12882 SEK ($1448) Payroll Tax = $2653/month
* Net Monthly Salary: 30279 SEK/month ($3403/month)
* Tax Rate: 43.8%

So in Stockholm my taxes are around 10.5 percentage points more than in the SF Bay Area. However, I you get an insane amount more from your taxes here in Sweden compared to what I got in the US. 

* Healthcare is 100% government subsidized after your annual 1100 SEK ($123) out of pocket maximum. Perscription medication is 100% government subsidized after your annual 2200 SEK ($246) out of pocket maximum. In the US I was paying around $126 each month for my employer health insurance plan (it was a non-HDHP plan as I am injured often since I play a lot of sports so I see the doctor a lot. I had 2 surgeries in my one year of working in the US after college alone) and my out of pocket maximum was $2500 annually.
* I don't have kids just yet (luckily) but day-care is extremely heavily subsidized by the Swedish government. Many of my coworkers in the US were paying $1200+ for their child's day care. Public schools are 100% free (just like in the US). University is 100% free for your bachelor's and master's and the government gives you around $325 each month just for being in school. You can also take out a low interest loan from the government if you want (under 1% interest rate per year). For PhD studies the stipend is quite high and actually enough to live on comfortably. At my school the average stipend was around 30000 SEK/month (after payroll, but before income tax) or 23248 SEK/month net ($2613/month).
* I could go on but the above are just two points that are definitely quite nice perks!

In the end, I have slightly less disposable income compared to what I was making in the US after accounting for medical/dental/vision insurance and bills, transportation, food, phone plan, etc. I haven't worked in the US or Sweden long enough to give a definite amount, but currently I have around 15% less disposable income after my monthly costs ( after accounting for retirement savings). Here are a few bullet points explaining why:

* Having a car is not necessary in Stockholm and actually can be somewhat of a pain in the ass. I was paying a lot for gas, my car finance payment, the bridge toll, and car insurance in the US. Total it was around $500/month for these. Here in Stockholm I am paying under 9010 SEK/year ($84/month) for the public transport pass which includes access to busses, the metro, the commuter train, the land train, and I believe two ferries. Its extremely easy to get from one place to another and the public transit system is simply amazing.
* Of course, medical/dental/vision are significantly cheaper in Sweden as already explained
* People here eat out way less than in the US. Almost everyone at my office and in general everyone I know here in the work force takes their lunch with them to work and eats at home during the week. Eating out is reserved for weekends on occasion or with friends/family.
* Gyms and phone plans are much cheaper
* Renting rooms is cheaper. You can rent a room in an apartment or someone's house in Stockholm for 4000 - 5000 SEK/month ($450 - $560 per month) versus $1250 - $1500 per month in the Mountain View and Palo Alto area.

The downsides so far have been that electronics are more expensive here (sometimes up to 25% more expensive) and clothes are more expensive too. Also, Swedish people are definitely not as outgoing and open as Americans but once you get to know them they are great people.

Overall, I have enjoyed my time here in Sweden quite a lot! I definitely wouldn't mind moving back to the US at some point and spending some more time in the SF Bay Area as I loved it there too, but I could definitely see myself settling down here in Europe when I get older, especially when I have kids.

Hopefully this helps if anyone is planning on moving to Europe! I know every European country is a bit different but Finland, Norway, and Denmark are all very similar to the above (except you can make a bit more money in Denmark and Norway than here in Sweden).

"Bit of backstory, my first stepmom was a lunatic. She treated her son (my stepbrother) like he was her husband, rather than my father. She would take him, my sister, and I to the store, buy him a super cool, expensive toy, then berate my sister and I for asking for something too (and it would usually be nothing even close to being as expensive or big as what he got). She would let him bully me, including knocking out my four front teeth (which I had to go without for almost a year cause the teeth weren‚Äôt ready to come out) and every time I tried to fight back he would immediately cry and run to her and I would get in trouble from her and my father, who only went along with her shenanigans cause he wanted someone to take care of him (aka a wife). 

The final straw was when my half brother was born. I was only 7, but I was expected to RAISE HIM. I had to feed him at ungodly times in the night while my dad and step mom slept, I had to change his diapers, bathe him, all of the things you had to do for a baby and all the while I was expected to still do well in school and choir (which I ended up having to quit because of all this). 

One day, they left me home alone (another thing they did frequently) and I decided enough was enough. My stepmom had taken her wedding ring off for who knows why and I saw my opportunity to mess with her. I went into their bathroom and just snatched it up, along with a couple other pretty rings I saw. I hid it in a hole in the couch that only I knew about and waited. 

Well she gets home and has a fit cause she can‚Äôt find her ring and of course accused me, but for once my dad stood up for me and said I would never. I left the ring there for a couple days until she gave up and had to believe she had just lost it. I then moved it to a toy box in my room where I forgot about it for many years. Me stealing the ring was the first in several things that caused their marriage to fall apart (not that they needed any help, they constantly fought from day 1 of their relationship). I found it again when I was moving out of my dad‚Äôs house at 18, and by then my crazy stepmom divorced my dad and he remarried to another lunatic lady (hence why I moved out before I even graduated high school). I still have the ring, as it‚Äôs very pretty and it constantly reminds me how I basically ended my dad and first stepmom‚Äôs marriage. I still think it‚Äôs hilarious to this day.

"[Here is a link to the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/6rewth/help_how_the_hell_do_you_move_your_career_forward/) from nine months ago.  First off, thank you again to everyone who responded.  Reading your thoughts made me realize that I need to focus on the factors that I have control over.  I cannot change my family, but I could do something about my dead-end job at my company.  It finally hit me that they were never going to do anything about by position unless I threatened to leave.  So, I started looking.  Within a couple of months I found a job that was very close to home, and was able to negotiate a pay bump.  I gave my notice to my current manager, which I felt terrible for, as he was a great guy who was already stressed out.  

The next day I am called into our division VP‚Äôs office, asking where I wanted to work, and he would make it happen.  He also told me to give him a number for salary.  I acquiesced.   But by this point I did not want to stay, so I gave them a high number I knew they could not come up with.  I do miss working with a group of ‚ÄòA‚Äô players, but looking back the place was a sinking ship (the VP who I greatly respected, has since left himself, and there have been two layoffs).  

Anyway, I am four months into the new job, and much less on edge.  As an added bonus I now have time to play with sandboxes at work, and even get a little study time in at lunch.  I have been able to develop my skills a lot more the Linux side, and after passing my NSX cert, I will start to learn Ansible.  My home situation has unfortunately not improved, and I still cannot get anything done (including posting Reddit updates) unless they are sleeping.  But, that‚Äôs life.

"In the last week, I've seen complaints about pretty much everything that is deemed a necessity at this point in society. Our phone bills are outrageous (worst in the world?), gas continues to creep up, and wages are stagnant. What can we do to curb this from an individual perspective? Just stop using cell phones (impossible)? Only take public transit (impossible)? Move closer to work (difficult to impossible)? What do? I feel like every year, we get squeezed a little bit more. Is there relief in sight?

EDIT: For the record, I like Canada. I like being Canadian. I like what Canada has to offer in terms of quality of life. But that doesn't mean I don't think there are some things that are severely over priced in terms of value per dollar. Telecom is a really killer. How is one of the richest countries in the world also one of the farthest behind in offering affordable telecom? Makes no sense. Fuel is another one I think that sticks out. I'm from Alberta, and as a natural resource focused economy, I find it difficult to reconcile how much we have to pay for a litre of gas. And I'm not blind to economics and how supply/demand impacts fuel cost (or how OPEC manipulates the market). These complaints do not diminish how much I love this country, but I think these industries could do better for the average Canadian. Seeing corporations make record profits off the backs of the regular consumer without giving anything back just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",False,1,False,"Are Canadians just getting fucked all ways to Sunday (wages, telecom, fuel, etc)?","r/canada",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gui6r",False,"dark","public",1201,"self.canada","",False,False,False,1201,"self",1525411879.0,True,"text",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2qh68","8gui6r",0,824,False,"/r/canada/comments/8gui6r/are_canadians_just_getting_fucked_all_ways_to/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/8gui6r/are_canadians_just_getting_fucked_all_ways_to/",362048,False,False,2048,"best"

"Decided to mess around, primarily with the dummies and see what changes I could find. Here is a list is no real order of things I found noteworthy while testing as the host.

* Most bleeds/burns/talents work on dummies (those I've tested do)
* Backstab angle ~120 default, improves to ~170 with trait (slightly less than 180). Tested with slow movement around the back of the dummy and shooting a line to it in the ground when a backstab occurred and then guessing the angle after both sides. Definitely over 90 and under 135 for the default angle.
* Shade 15 +75% backstab damage talent doesn't work (stays at +50% bonus)
* Ranged backstabs do bonus backstab damage, but do not grant ammo with talent
* With dual weapons only 1 attack receives infiltrate bonus, other is normal attack.
* Backstab is still additive base damage, which means backstab with infiltrate is fairly small bonus since infiltrate doesn't seem to alter power.
* Damage cap removed or damage exceeding the cap is dealt as a separate bonus hit (could be dummy exclusive but my testing is showing it in game as well)
* Standing too close removes floating hit values but appears to still deal damage (infiltrate is removed on hit whereas it remains if you miss)
* Burns/bleeds have power scaling per weapon
* Barrage ranged weapon trait lasts 5 seconds, stacks 5 times and is applied to the first hit
* Saltyspyre Blessed Shot doesn't refresh barrage
* Hunter ranged weapon trait lasts 10 seconds, applies on the first crit, can not be refreshed, but can be applied to multiple damage types at once (multiple separate buffs)
* Beam staff deals burn damage equal to beam damage per tick with the 2 highest ticks with a 1.0 multiplier vs unarmored and 0.75 vs armored (while beam itself is 1.0 vs unarmored and 0.5 vs armored, meaning the burn from the beam does more vs armored than the beam itself).
* Burns (bleeds untested but probably the same) don't receive bonus dmg from headshots or crits
* Conflag/fireball/bomb aoe doesn't affect armored dummies
* Conflag does more damage longer it's charged (duh) until max, does much more damage to enemies in the inner circle and at full charge has 3 zones of dmg. Regardless of distance, all enemies take the same weak burn dot (2.75 with 600 power) that scales slightly with charge time
* Fireball does max damage for most of it's aoe then quickly falls off at the edges. Applies 1 weak burn tick (2.75 with 600 power)
* Light attack with flamethrower weapons doesn't apply a burn
* Burn ticks are a substantial part of the charged attack damage on flamethrowers (as anticipated)
* Slayer trophy hunter is 10% dmg per stack, applies with first hit, and scales with crits (this has been known but I point it out because it's unlike backstab)
* Slayer 15 talent Unstoppable changes trophy hunter from 2s to 5s duration (was 3s I think).
* Slayer 10 talent Crippling Wounds is the expected debuff of 20% bonus dmg to target and lasts ~5s. can be applied to multiple targets simultaneously
* Slayer dual axes have damage fall off on multiple targets now. Not that you could hit them before anyway on higher difficulties.
* Open/close command console (f2) no longer allows movement before the cutscene finishes
* All bombs deal impact damage. On legend both bombs deal 5.75 (scale with power, not difficulty) with a body shot, 8.5 headshot, 8.5 crit bodyshot, and 11.25 crit headshot vs unarmored. The armored multiplier seems to be half the unarmored for impacts (and I suspect it's the same for the aoe).  These impacts appear to be able to crit without blessed shot, but I don't care to test it.
* Bomb aoe deals 105 at the center vs unarmored, scale with difficulty not power, and have damage falloff
* Incendiary aoe deals 19.75 aoe at the center vs unarmored, scale with difficulty not power, and have damage falloff, no burn dot
* Blessed shot consumed by bomb throw (known), and gives bombs guaranteed crit for the impacted target (not the aoe).
* As we've assumed, all aoe attacks don't seem to be able to crit except melee attacks with ranged weapons

Things I've tested in game as host with bots.

* Stormfiend fire trails do damage players very inconsistently
* My fps is considerably worse during hordes
* ~~My infiltrate tests aren't showing it exceeding dmg cap in game, but i haven't tested thoroughly. I can say the glaive downward heavy did 129 (scoreboard so rounded) to a Stormfiend from the front w/o headshot on Legend. Going to try to hit a headshot on a different boss and see if I can pass the cap.~~ Just hit a 299 on a Stormfiend from the front that may or may not have been a headshot. That doesn't really matter because I'm 99% sure I only hit it once with the glaive heavy downward strike and it exceeded the old cap of 255.75 (256 on scoreboard) confirming that you can exceed the cap in game in this patch.

What do these things mean?  As for Shade, imo dual weapons are dead if it stays this way. Their main draw was boss damage coupled with 2 elites kills at once. They can't do either anymore. If you can surpass the damage cap (and it appears you can), glaive may be the only choice because of the incredible damage potential. The damage cap primarily affects Shade and Huntsman, although I'm unsure if Huntsman could hit it against bosses (where it matters) anyway.",False,0,False,"Some undocumented 1.0.8 beta changes I found","r/Vermintide",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gxbxg",False,"dark","public",118,"self.Vermintide","",False,False,False,118,"self",1525421223.0,True,"text",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_36d6l","8gxbxg",0,65,True,"/r/Vermintide/comments/8gxbxg/some_undocumented_108_beta_changes_i_found/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/8gxbxg/some_undocumented_108_beta_changes_i_found/",40495,False,False,2048,"best"

I understand that having children or being over 35 make women fairly low value but maybe you just have low standards or are desperate. I understand that a woman's age is the single most important determinant of her worth and mine is around zero as there are younger options.

Anyway if you for some strange reason don't consider me to be totally without value, Please PM me. I want to feel worth something.

"[My puppy](https://imgur.com/a/8VDwY3a) (he's 6 months old) is a half Siberian Husky/half German Shepard and he's been quite the test in patients since I brought him home (I've had other dogs, but this one has to have the last word/woof and does things on his own time).  Anyway, at about 5:30 this morning, I hear him barking like crazy.  Not something he does normally.

So, half asleep I go into the loft and he's standing and barking at a small fire that has started.  I was disoriented and completely shocked by the flames that were starting to spread.  Fortunately, I keep a fire extinguisher upstairs and quickly put the fire out.

Oddly, there really wasn't any smoke, just a strong smell of an electrical fire (I later discovered it had come from an old power strip).  Anyway, I don't know if the fire alarms would have sounded in time for me to contain the fire.  

And as much as I'd like to think that I would have eventually woken up to the smell or even the sound, I don't know that for a fact.  So, today my little buddy is my hero!  And he may have earned even more patients when it comes to him listening.

"I'm in a master degree in university in France at the moment. For years I was so sure all I wanted to do is a PhD in the field I'm studying since I started university (which is political sociology). 

To be able to do so I have to find money and the main way to find money in France is some sort of a contract you have with university which pays you to do your research. Since we're a lot to seek funding for PhD and there is very few contracts available (about 90 students for 15 contracts), there is a tough, stressful selection process. If I wanted to try it, i would have to submit my final dissertation on June 15, and write in the same time my letters to be candidate for the contracts. 

Last week my research director said to me that despite the work I already did was not too bad I had a lot more to do. More than I expected anyway. Since that day I've been so stressed out I was physically ill. So I decided to step aside and use the opportunity given to submit my dissertation in september (which means that I wont be able to start a PhD this year). 

Since I decided that I'm feeling a lot more at peace, less stressed but I can't help myself to be sad about that missed opportunity.

"All the projects planning airdrops on EOS *must* read this.

EOSdac just completed its airdrop in a 1:1 manner for EOS tokens. The result? A several hundred million dollar market cap. Out of thin air. In a few days. At the same moment, by keeping some tokens to themselves, the team self-funded.

This demonstrates the immensely innovative economic model of EOS that essentially no one has caught onto yet. EOS is going to move us away from the insane ICO model that people have been doing on Ethereum for so long. It leads to poor distributions as people try to get in early and then sell for 10x on the market later. And also it leads to trouble as these ICOs are investments and the SEC will certainly be interested in them.

So now we see how simple and effective the path forward is to self fund your project on EOS. If you want funding for your project on EOS, here is what you do. You don't have to do KYC, have people sign up, do bounties, or anything else. Tell people about it, have a presence, make a website. Announce a countdown. But that's it. And then just airdrop the damn tokens. Bomb the chain in a 1:1 manner. Keep 10% or so for yourself as a bounty. BOOM. You just made a market and now own a significant chunk. If your project is any good it will be held onto by the token holders and have a high price. If your project is terrible it will be valued lower. But probably it will be valued in the tens of millions at minimum, and if you have any potential at all, possibly even the hundreds of millions. Therefore, the projects will find natural market caps. The more you succeed the bigger your share will grow.

EOSdac just *proved* you could make a market out of thin air by letting the EOS distribution list hold onto tokens, evaluate the project, and then buy or sell dependent on whether they like the project.

So forget doing an ICO. There is no ICO. Just an airdrop. Which means there are no security laws. There are no contributions or list of contributors to worry about. There is nothing. You are just distributing some ""worthless"" tokens free of charge to a distribution of addresses. It's not an investment and you don't need to worry about the SEC. No one does. If people then *want* to make a market (oh and believe me they will if your project is good) they do that of their own accord. Note that this mimics exactly what block.one did with EOS, by distributing the tokens and then letting *others* start the chain. You distribute your tokens, don't price them or sell them yourself, and let *others* make the market. You then own a nice little chunk of that market. 

So forget about KYC, forget about collecting emails, forget all that. Forget about the SEC and security laws too. Just drop the tokens, keep a bit for yourself, and let the market sort it out.

"So I downloaded tinder when I was 18, and being single in a big city, I ended up going on a lot of fun dates. One guy really caught my attention, because well, he was really really attractive. We chatted a bit, and I felt pretty into him so I decided we could meet for coffee. He was sweet, charming, and we had a great conversation about school, art and music. We found out we were both musicians, and the date was going so well that I agreed to walk the few blocks back to his house so he could play some music for me.

I was new to online dating, and was still fairly naive so I followed him into his weird converted garage bedroom and sat down on the couch while he pulled out his keyboard. He played for a while, and I started getting a little antsy. He was super into the music, and kinda getting aggressive with the keyboard. He was slamming keys down and making these weird noises, so I shot up out of my seat and told him that I should get going soon. 

He totally went back to normal, his tone changed and his posture became less hunchbacked, so when he apologized for getting carried away I agreed to sit back down on the couch so we could talk more. 

He came and sat down next to me, and we went back to our earlier conversation. He seemed back to normal and nice, so when he asked if he could kiss me, I agreed. 
He leaned in toward me and I closed my eyes waiting. And I waited but didn‚Äôt feel his lips, so I opened my eyes a peek and saw him staring at me. 

I threw my head back surprised, but he had snaked his hand back toward my hair and interwoven his fingers so I couldn‚Äôt move. He then inhaled deeply and told me ‚Äú You smell like you‚Äôre Jewish. I can tell because you smell like my aunts house‚Äù. I was totally freaked out at this point (partly because yes I am Jewish), and tried to wiggle away from him frantically stating that I had to go. 

He then jumped on top of me, and to my horror started sobbing, yelling that he‚Äôs so sorry he made me uncomfortable. 
His body weight was completely preventing me from moving, so I forced myself to rub his back. I told him that I wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable at all, and that he was really sweet. He made me promise over and over again that I‚Äôd see him again before finally getting up off of me. 

I moved to the door and tried calmly to tell him that I really needed to go. He was blocking my way and all I could think of was that I needed him to let me leave, I couldn‚Äôt fight him off. He told me I needed to kiss him before I could leave, and I quickly pecked him on the lips. He smiled at me, and I was glad that he didn‚Äôt expect more. ‚ÄúCall me please. I think that went well‚Äù he said, as he opened up the garage door and I scurried out. 

I called my mom and started crying as soon as I was far enough away. She called me a cab home and I blocked him from every way we had contacted each other. 
I saw him once after that on campus, and that was enough for me. So I hope we never meet again!

Jon Stewart who all these bitchy twat waffles keep cunting around about continues his league leading third and short conversion saving some tread on Barkley's tires. 


Our new DC mastermind, James ""the Butcher"" Bettcher is going to lay waste to the likes of Smith, Dak, and Wetzle the pretzel. The new DL will transitions from this boring ass slow moving, no subbing, snooze fest to a machine gun rotation that just punches opposing OLs straight in the mouth for 60 minutes on Sunday. All-Pro Vernon (league leading sacks), Ogletree, Jenkins, and Collins have their best seasons as they bend the rest of the NFC beast over a barrel and has their way with them. Apple gets his shit together and leads the team with 7 INTs. The pain train is fucking coming mother fuckers.


10-6 and a wild card playoff birth. Giants take a road trip back to Lambeau and exorcise any demons as OBJ goes for 120 yards and 2 TDs, he then buys a boat. Next round Giants go back to the Shurmur's old stomping ground and embarrass his pupil who the Vikings wouldn't let us hire as OC. NFC championship, guess who, Eagles. Yup, fuck you Eagles. Snacks literally picks Carson Wentz up and throws him through the uprights, who promptly retires out of disgrace. SB has the Giants beating the Pats 50-0, Bettcher gets a HC gig and Belichick elects to be new DC.


OBJ and LC re-upped for 5 years each.

"Hello fellow woke gentlemen, 

I'm a lurker when it comes to reddit, but TRP has truly helped me a lot in life and the material I've shared with friends has had very positive and tangible effects on their lives as well. Moderators, I know my account is a bit inactive, but please acknowledge this post. Thank you's aside, something has very recently occurred that I need to share, and this appears the place to do it.

That event:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/05/02/boy-scouts-drop-the-boy-as-they-welcome-girls-to-scouts-bsa/?noredirect=on

A few days ago, it was announced that the Boy Scouts of America is dropping ""Boy"" from its name, as it allows girls to enter its cub and boy scout ranks. The campaign to allow in girls has been raging for years now, from my perspective beginning because some girls (or more likely their parents) want the prestigious title of Eagle Scout, the highest rank and honor of the former BSA, on their resume. It has already lost a bit of its shine in recent years as standards/checks have faltered, but just wait to see how it will diminish going forward. Mommy's little girl will get that rank, or else. 

There does exist the Girl Scouts, a comparatively boring and uncool organization, as well as Venture Scouts, an excellent organization under the same people that's coed and is often involved in BSA activities, sharing resources (They are the ones that wear the green uniforms). The Girl Scouts complained the other day about their membership being stolen. I don't blame them, maybe they should let boys in! 

This is, above all, an invasion of male space on a new level. This organization will not survive it: it WILL fundamentally change because of girls' entry. Some of the involved activities; construction service projects, shooting sports and training, war games, survival endurance competitions and tests, hands-on first aid training, peculiar, near fraternal, initiation rites among internal troops and OA groups; are doomed with the inflow of girls. They, particularly the resume-builders, will not want any part of these 'difficult' and 'testing' things. They will critique them, embarrass the boys doing them, and make them unpopular. The coming of age rituals, at least what's left of them, will be interrupted. That's how females operate in society. We have just opened the BSA and its young, developing males to be closely judged. The BSA is no longer a place for young guys to be themselves and relax in the outdoors with other males. 

It will now devolve into a messy, coed summer camp with drama and worry. Uniforms will become mere fashion statements. Just look at the picture circulating now of the girl cub scout with an untucked dress-uniform shirt, ridiculous. Imagine how the summer camps will need to segregate the showers, tents, and changing areas; prevent underage intercourse or even the extreme of statutory rape (13 YOs and 18 YOs in same troop); and how awkward in general inter-troop dynamics will become. Things will go from tribes of boys to conflicts between tribes of both sexes. Let your mind run wild for a sec. Why add this confusion and upset to a happy organization? Welcome to corrosive progressivism. 

Some may ask if the current BSA leadership will enforce strict rules and hold the girls up to the male standard. I will say now that this will not happen. The leadership, many of whom are the parents of these little snowflakes, will cave to the crying girl every time. We have already had the problem of female adult leadership in the Scouts, which has often led to issues involving the vested interests of mothers and the weaknesses of their momma's boys. 

There are a few alternatives for boys now, but none are as national, respected, and funded as the BSA. I do not know how I will ensure my future sons will have the experiences, training, and wholesome fun I have had as a scout. The BSA has existed for the past 100 years to provide military/draft-ready men, with traditional values, who could survive on their own in a variety of situations, from infrastructure collapses to small emergency situations. The motto is ""Be Prepared."" 

As an Eagle Scout and Brotherhood member of the OA, less than two years out of the organization, I am beyond disheartened with this. One of the last bastions of hope fell this week. We know how impossible it is for things to regress these days. America has just lost one of her finest institutions. I guess I'm just old patriarchal history now. I will forever be a proud former member of the BSA, but never of the 'Scouts BSA.' 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: (fixed some grammar) 
It is nice to see so many old scouters on TRP, thank you for giving my thoughts a read! It's very true, some of the most intense, nostalgic experiences thousands of others and I have had have been in scouting; some of my closest friends are old troop buddies. Those nights in the woods and myriad of injuries/challenges made me tough. Also, I learned to appreciate the trades, something forgotten about in our ""everyone goes to college"" society. We all can hardly wait to see the female response to the lifesaving, wilderness survival, pioneering, and automotive maintenance merit badges. Or the fact that the cooking one is mandatory...

My grief begins with the lack of a fight against this change. The Mormons are allegedly withdrawing 180k boys, but otherwise the majority of the membership is against it, yet no one is very audibly speaking out. Is there censorship? Hidden interests? Very possibly, and our male youth will lose out on a hell of a lot of the needed seeds of virility as a result. A point was made in the comments that needs to be repeated: this decision came as a demand from above. Local councils, scoutmasters, the scouts themselves were never asked for their say. This was an order from the progressive executives on top of the organization. A scary metaphor for what could come in our other institutions...

"I‚Äôm a new dm who has been doing it for a few months now and I‚Äôve been trying to improve something every week I play. One of the things I changed was having npcs treat players the way they would treat a member of that race.

To me in the world of dnd prejudice is a given because how what race you are has a lot in determining how you are. Even though he is a good drow when someone encounters him on the street they are going to inherently mistrust him until proven otherwise.

I think this became an issue because I wasn‚Äôt treating him like a drow from the beginning so just suddenly doing it might have annoyed him.

This also comes up in combat where he says I‚Äôm purposely not giving him a way to fight in broad daylight. Drows get disadvantage in sunlight so when they have an encounter while traveling he‚Äôll say that I never give him shade to fight in. To me being a drow comes with that disadvantage, so either he needs to persuade the group to travel slower but more advantageous for him or just travel at night.

Am I being to much of a tight ass about the race he chose? How has having a drow affected your campaigns?

"By u/chipathing


The Human looked at me, big expecting smile on it's face and a plate of pastry covered in red sauce and dangerously hot dairy product on the table. I crooked my head, looking at it with one eye and then the other, trying to understand what exactly the Human was expecting to happen.

We'd found this species on a nitrogen rich mudball of a planet and ever since we've uplifted them they've been nothing but headache after diplomatic incident after headache. I'm not a major government official, quite the opposite, merely an integration agent who's superior has seen fit to punish me by way of assigning me *PERMANENTLY* to the human file.

So you can understand why I‚Äôm frustrated.

Anyways for the past two months I've been dealing with a humans whose overly long names I haven't bothered to remember. My latest case file and I hadn‚Äôt gotten along well in our correspondences, it was clear things were ungood between us and I suspect that this supposedly edible scalding hazard was it's attempt at restoring Kaa'/Human relations. I'm not sure why he did since I have a beak without any molars and my body has no ability to digest dairy and processed grains made a trip to the bathroom resemble an extinction level event.

‚ÄúWhat exactly is this?‚Äù I asked it bluntly, feathers ruffling under my administrative robes.

The human spread its lips and revealed a still unnerving mouth full of teeth, was he...threatening me?

‚ÄúIt's Pizza!‚Äù it said in a loud and energetic way, my tertiaries nearly fully ruffled by now. Was everything this species did loud and otherwise as subtle as a supernova?

‚ÄúRight...‚Äù I muttered, vocal synthesizer in my throat prompting errors as it tried to figure out what tone to use... I was in a similar position. ‚ÄúPizza...‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's quite good‚Äù the human assured me. My eyes flicked up and down, at the pizza and then at the human's face. This had to be joke.

‚ÄúI'm sure‚Äù I said, pulling up several forms for the human to fill out.

The human reached it's unbearably hairy hand under the...Peeza and peeled a wedge of it off. It cupped the still burning hot pastry with steaming sauce and without hesitation opened it's maw to bite down on the slice, it's mouth opening and closing repeatedly as it fought to cope with the temperature of the food. Was this...was this some sort of pain endurance ritual?

‚ÄúHits Huaite ood‚Äù said the human through a molten ball of pastry and pain. The human was disturbingly hung up on me eating the pizza. Sighing I rolled my eye and pulled a piece of it off. I'd take a bite or two, admit defeat, and then proceed with the paperwork so I could go back to my home where I'm sure my mate will be waiting to foist the chicks on me while she worked on her Kaa‚Äô Heck Yes fan fiction.

Balancing the haphazard food on my talons I took a bite with my beak, wincing as the scalding hot dairy and vegetable paste made contact. I retracted my tongue as far back as it would go and panted while the mass of oily pizza rolled around in my beak, scalding whatever it touched. What possible purpose could such a torturous foodstuff have!?

When the glob in my beak had cooled down enough I gingerly tasted it, aged and spiced meats, very fatty, not bad, some sweet tasting vegetables for additional flavouring. My internal secretary noted the plant matter and scheduled a small delivery of digestive aids and supplements. I rolled the food around in my mouth and made a show of swallowing it for the human.

‚ÄúSo‚Äù the human asked excitedly, leaning forward.

I cleared my throat and took a long breath ‚ÄúIt was awful‚Äù I told it, I had a sheet digitized in front of the human and prepared to continue the integration process.

‚ÄúAnyways I'll need you to sign here and here saying you understand you'll have to apply for a federation citizenship within five micro cycles otherwise-‚Äù

The human interrupted me ‚ÄúWhat do you mean it was awful?‚Äù it asked.

‚ÄúI mean it was almost exclusively plant matter and I find plant matter to be disgusting owing to me and my entire race being Carnivores. Or did that fact slip you by?‚Äù

It's lips flapped as it looked around, distraught ‚ÄúBut it's pizza, everyone likes it...‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm sure on earth it's a hoot but you're not on earth anymore, please sign here‚Äù I pushed the digitized sheet to the human, a pen floating to the human's hand.

‚ÄúI just...‚Äù the human went quiet.

‚ÄúJust what?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI always imagined everyone would like pizza...‚Äù muttered the human.

‚ÄúEveryone always thinks they're so special‚Äù I muttered back.

The Human summoned its power of observation to realize I‚Äôd made a remark at him. This combined at me having the gall to criticize a foodstuff my species was not meant to eat must have been the final stone because he stood up from his seat with his palms on the table.

‚ÄúWhat exactly is your problem?‚Äù he said angrily. I sighed and my internal secretary primed a panic signal to the office security.

I leaned forward and crooked my head to one side so I could be eye to eyes with him. ‚ÄúMy problem, human, is that you and every other race we uplift seems to think you‚Äôre the universe‚Äô gift to our galaxy.‚Äù 

That seemed to hit a sore spot because the human backed away and looked at me slightly confused and angry. I wondered if that was the face a human made when they started thinking.

‚ÄúI bet you feel all full of yourself with your superior technology and galaxy spanning empire but I came from Earth!‚Äù the human declared triumphantly. 

I ruffled my feathers sarcastically ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs as characterful as you are.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúNow if you could just sign this visa I can show you out...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou probably don‚Äôt know the first thing about earth or humans‚Äù it continued. Oh boy we were going to be here for a while. My internal secretary scheduled a chick-sitter app. 

While the human spoke I downloaded the human entry on encyclopedia galactica. After I made sure it wasn‚Äôt riffled with errors I cleared my throat and waited for the human to finish up.

‚Äú-And we have lots of art and theatre and...I mean like we fought a ton of wars and we‚Äôre really passionate and I bet your race doesn‚Äôt have pack bonding like we do!‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you done?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWell I was going to bring up that I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre awesome lovers but-‚Äù

I interrupted ‚ÄúDoes yours vibrate?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry what?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes. Yours. Vibrate? It‚Äôs a simple question human‚Äù I repeated.

‚ÄúI mean...no but‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair ‚ÄúThen human‚Äôs are not the greatest lovers in the galaxy‚Äù I said ‚Äúanyways-‚Äù

‚ÄúWait...Does yours vibrate?‚Äù it asked.

‚Äúlook I hate to break this to you but I don‚Äôt work here for the thrill of helping fresh off the monolith types like you. I don‚Äôt have time to talk about who‚Äôs bits do or don‚Äôt vibrate.‚Äù

I brought up a few folders on human history and did a quick skim through the important centuries while the human was sitting down and finally signing his damn visa.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs...damn that‚Äôs a lot of wars‚Äù I said. The human looked up, perhaps the mere mention of war was enough for them to get excited. Who knew with the young races.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really good at fighting them‚Äù It said with pride. I nodded slowly.

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs a good thing?‚Äù I asked, genuinely curious what sort of response I was going to get.

The human noticed my apprehension at the mention of war. ‚ÄúOh yeah! I mean our high gravity and challenging weather means we‚Äôre built tough and strong. I‚Äôve heard we can punch clean through most races-‚Äù

‚ÄúTry me human‚Äù I said bluntly. ‚ÄúAnd more to the point I‚Äôm somewhat curious how dangerous you think your planet is‚Äù

This lit the human right up ‚ÄúOh man I bet you‚Äôve never seen something like earth! We‚Äôve got parts of the planet that can change from 30 degrees Celsius to negative fifty!‚Äù

‚ÄúAh yes‚Äù I nodded ‚ÄúThe dreaded climate, I‚Äôm quivering in my puny xeno booties‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no! I mean like we have these tiny insects that can spread a whole host of diseases and we have lions and bears and-‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you have parasites and apex predators on your planet?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù the human agreed ‚ÄúAnd are bodies are just full of bacteria to help with our function and we have latent stuff in our blood streams-‚Äù

‚ÄúAn immune system? Is that what you‚Äôre trying to describe?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm...yes?‚Äù

I sighed, suddenly a lot less angry and just sorry for the poor fool. 

‚ÄúListen...‚Äù I glanced at his name on the file for the first time ‚ÄúMicheal Jenkins...I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre proud of your race but sentient life has very strict criteria and civilizations many more so. You have to have a planet that‚Äôs difficult to live on to get anywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut earth is...‚Äù

I cut him off ‚ÄúA Class A garden world that, given how your race treated it, should be under protective custody‚Äù

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre...normal?‚Äù he asked. I nodded again and slid another document across the table for him to sign.

‚ÄúI mean like you said humans have fought a lot of wars‚Äù

Once again the human lit up. I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying I should join the army?‚Äù he asked excitedly.

‚ÄúDo you have any prior military training?‚Äù

‚Äú...no‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what makes you think you‚Äôd be accepted?‚Äù

‚Äú...humans are good at fighting?‚Äù

I pray to the great crow to throw either brains or rocks at this human as long as they hit their mark ‚ÄúHuman *soldiers* are good at fighting. Have you considered getting a writer‚Äôs grant? You clearly have an active imagination‚Äù

The human took my suggestion and ended up taking a digital copy of the grant application. I bid him good day and requested that he take his nauseating pizza with him.

I sighed with relief when he walked out of my office. My internal secretary called fourth the next applicant. Another human walked in, two bumps on its chest and hair dyed blue. She cautiously stepped forward and remained quiet as she gently sat in the seat when offered. Hopefully she would be more courteous.

‚ÄúNow miss... Amanda... You‚Äôre applying for a travel visa, is that correct?‚Äù

She nodded. I crooked my head. ‚ÄúAre you alright to speak? I asked. 

In the faintest whisper she leaned in and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt you with my voice‚Äù she said.

*wat*

I asked her to elaborate which, to the detriment of my brain cells, she did ‚ÄúI know aliens can be fragile and I didn‚Äôt want to speak too loudly, I‚Äôve heard we can shout you guys apart and I don‚Äôt want to do that‚Äù

"I played guitar hero from the beginning, I know that expert on beat saber is supposed to be difficult like that. I remember having to slow down songs and only play certain parts over and over to learn them just to beat it on expert. And that‚Äôs great that beat saber is modeled like that on expert.

Except for the fact that in a vr point of view, you literally can‚Äôt see notes behind the notes your hitting. It‚Äôs not just a matter of too much on screen, you really can‚Äôt see what is coming. 

I don‚Äôt believe the only way to beat the songs should be through memorizing the parts since you can‚Äôt actually see the notes. So Devs if you are listening, you need to figure out a way to drop the notes at an angle or something so that they are visible from further away when the screen gets cluttered or obstacles come in front of you.

I dry plucked it by hand the last time I tried and I ended up with some minor RSI and it took like 3 days to get it clean of feathers. The last day was mostly tweezer work. I'm looking into wet methods and I see people recommending squirting a bit of dish soap into the scalding water.

Personally, I'm going to try paraffin wax in the scalding water to see if that works. Any tips are appreciated!

"When I was growing up and we would be ready to go on vacation or something similar, I would stress about how much money my parents would be about to spend (I know,I was a weird anxious child).

Just last night I thought to myself, ""Oo, I should have a jolly rancher,"" and the refrain came back to me. I absolutely use this sort of mantra in my weight loss journey. It's not about depriving myself, it's about saving calories on the small stuff that doesn't bring me much joy (tortilla for a daily wrap, toast because it's the easiest thing to eat for breakfast, soggy gone-cold fries, a few tablespoons of half and half in coffee that would taste good without it) so that I can spend on the big stuff that I'll truly love (a cake I made for a coworkers birthday, a twice-a-month Rally's chicken sandwich, a really good caramel at the end of a long day).

"Much like a lot of people during college I had a part-time job at a major coffee chain. It was great because it provided me with extra cash and an unlimited supply of caffeine. Like most chains, the driving factor to draw people in is excellent customer service and that no matter how ridiculous the customer is ALWAYS right. 

On this specific day right before our major rush the only customers we had was a husband, wife with their 4 kids (ages 2-5). Wife tells husband her order while they go through the line and walks out.  The 4 girls eventually follow her out after looking through pastry case while husband makes the order. 

No big deal at his point, pretty normal interaction, but I notice one of the girls has take a bottle of water from the pastry case so I mention it to the husband. Husband was really cool about it and even through I told him it was no big deal he still paid the $1.95 for the bottle. 

15-20 minutes go by and our rush has started. We have 15+ people now in line and the husband marches back in straight up to me clearly upset as he walks past the line. 

Husband says to me ,""Hey! Why did you tell me my daughter stole a bottle of water?""

Me: ""My apologies sir, it must have only looked like your daughter took as bottle of water. Not to worry, let me get you back the $1.95""

Husband: ""What's with the attitude? Are you calling me a LIAR???"" - guys is making a pretty big scene and everyone is looking.

Me: ""Not at all sir. I just meant I must have been incorrect with watching your daughter walk out the door holding a bottle of water."" I am this point holding the money out to the husband and he is refusing to take it.

Husband: ""It's not about the $1.95, it about the principal. If you are calling me a liar, we can take this outside?""

Me: ""No sir. Please, you are holding up our line now and need to take your refund and leave.""

Husband: Starts saying talk a bunch of crap but is slowly going. Finally after taking the money he say one last condescending remark to many that finally rubs me the wrong way.

Me: ""Thank you sir. Have a nice day. Enjoy your bottle of water.""

This then leads to the husband throwing his $1.95 back at me, completely missing me, and hitting one of my co-workers instead. Husband starts demanding to speak to my manager immediately. Luckily, at that moment the manager was out so we defused the situation and told the husband to comeback in an hour to speak to the manager. 

Now after all this build up here comes my petty revenge!  

After the husband left, my manager got back about 30 minutes later. I explained everything that happened while he was gone. My manager looked perplexed about the story because when he walked in the store after he got back there was an unopened bottle of water shoved between a bunch of coffee mugs on a stand right in front of the entrance. My manager decided to pull the store security tapes and lo-in-behold the motherfucker put it on the shelf seconds before confronting me at the cash register. 

Guy then comes back just a bit later with a buddy absolutely steaming. I happened to meet him at the front door when he walked in and he demanded to see my manager and telling me he's about to get me fired. My manager comes out to talk to the guy and I slowly stalked off just in ear shot pretending to clean tables to get a front row seat of the show. 

Husband takes no time at all and yells: ""I demand an apology, my money back, and that guy fired (and points at me)."" 

My manager calmly turns around, grabs the bottle of water that is still sitting on the shelf behind him, hands it to the guy, and says, ""no I don't think so. After looking at the security footage, we watched you bring the bottle back and place it back on the shelf.""

The sheer look of horror on the husbands face was priceless! I had never seen a person so stunned in my life. It was great, the guy started backtracking and sputtering out non-nonsensical apologies. 

The crowning moment was still to come. 

My manager then pulls out the $1.95 that was thrown back at me earlier in an envelope with $1.95 wrote on the outside, hands it to the guys, and says, ""Clearly you need this more than we do. Now after you apologize to my barista you can get out of my store.""  

The husband was so embarrassed, he refused to take the money back. I have now drifted close enough by, that the guy reaches his hand out to me, shakes my hand, apologizes, and then walks out the store utterly annihilated.

"This happened about ten years ago. I worked in retail for a major cell phone carrier but was on my lunch break shopping at a big box store in the same shopping center. I was wearing a dress shirt and slacks as well as a pink tie in honor of breast cancer awareness month. I had gone in to buy a video game but was accosted by a lady in her late fifties, early sixties as I walked to the back of the store. For reference I am ME. Lady is L and random young employee of the store is E.

L: Excuse me, the employee over there is being very rude to me when I told her I want to return my broken tv.

ME: Oh? (I was tired and just wanted to get my game and get out I didn't make the connection she assumed I worked there) Sorry to hear that (probably had a confused look on my face). 

L: The tv I bought here three months ago isn't working. And they tell me I have to talk to Samsung.

At this point, a store employee runs up and tries to talk to the lady but she cuts her off.

L: I already told him you were rude to me I don't want your help anymore. (Looks back at me) Why will your store not help me that is poor customer service.

E: Mam he isn't a mana...

She cuts the employee off again by putting her hand in her face. It is at this point I realize that the employee is wearing a pink shirt as are all the other employees so the lady must think I am the manager.

L: Well are you going to help me?

ME: Like you were already told mam you will need to go back through the manufacturer unless you purchased an extended warranty from us which I assume you didn't or my associate would have helped you.

L: Thats it I'm calling corporate (and she huffed off).

"I used to work for a small but well know hotel chain. It was close to a popular venue for raves. All of the front desk agents would look up when raves would be there to prepare for the guests who come here afterwards. They always ask for a late check out and raid our snack bar, if they have money. One of these guys stood out in particular.

It's Sunday and I'm working dayshift. We get told from the auditor that some kids (I say kids, they were maybe 20 or 21) from a rave checked in last night. I roll my eyes and am just thankful it's a Sunday. Those days were usually slow and not a lot of guests were in the hotel. It slows down after breakfast as that's when most people are checked out. The ravers are still in their room which is no surprise.

Check out time comes and that room is still occupied. They didn't ask for a late check out and the housekeeping manager said there was a DND on their door and a funny smell coming from their room. I call the room and inform them that it's time to check out and, of course, now they ask for a late check out. I said yes as we had only a few people checking in that night anyway. I wish I would have said no because they took a mile.

About a half hour later, I'm starting to get wiffs of that funny smell so I walk towards their room and it's clear they were/are smoking weed. All of our rooms are non smoking and weed isn't legal in my state. So double whammy. I didn't knock since they were still within their extension time. But as time went on, the weed smell got stronger and I was getting pissed. Other guests could smell it. I called them at the end of their late check out and inform them that their time is up. The guy on the phone said they were just heading out. They took their time and 45 MINUTES LATER, they were gone.

Once they left, I investigated their room and took my phone with me. I had a bad feeling about these guys and I feel like they took advantage of the late check out as an excuse to hot box. I could BARELY breathe in that room. The smell was SO BAD. I took in the damage. Cigarette butts everywhere, empty liquor bottles, half smoked blunts. My two favorites are the weed in the trash that looks like they tried to cover up and the dried up puke on the bed. I took pictures of all of that and called my supervisor. She said to charge their card the fee for smoking in our rooms. It's $300 so I decided to put the pictures I took on the computer at the front desk so come Monday, my super can see proof and my ass is saved if the card holder calls us about the fee.

Sure enough, he did. I was off on Monday and got a call from my super. Turns out the card belonged to the father of one of the kids. He was PISSED and claims that his son doesn't smoke. My super explained that their room was non smoking room and someone had smoked in it. The paper they sign when they check in explains our non-smoking policy and the fee. He is demanding a refund and sent us an e-mail ""so it's in writing"". My super replied with the pictures I took of the cigarette butts and said there was proof of smoking so we cannot refund him.

"Throwaway Account for obvious reasons

Quick background: I work in IT Security, but have a few side jobs that I do for fun/extra money. One of those side jobs is repairing laptop computers, tablets, cell phones, etc. I also do custom PC builds for people as well.

So, the way I network is through word of mouth, and business cards. Long story short, a guy at my kickboxing academy approached me and asked if I could fix his laptop. He told me he was having performance issues, and complained that his PC freezes and blue screens with no warning.

I go through the normal routine, and have him sign a contract agreeing to pay me for my services, as well as granting me full control over the device while I carry out repairs, etc. 

He agreed, and asked that if the computer can't be fixed, at least recover his files to the best of my ability and place them on an external drive for safe keeping. 

Now, I have a big disclaimer that I have the person sign off on that literally reads as follows: ""I will respect the privacy of your data, however I will look into any area that the problems you're having may lead me to. That being said is there anything on the computer that you would not want me to see?"" if the user says yes, I tell them to clean up the computer and bring it back when its safe for me to look at. I'm not interested in looking at naked pictures of the guy or his wife, for example. This guy said no, and signed off on the disclaimer.

long story short, the laptop was an older model but I was able to get everything up and running again. However, this is where the story gets messed up. 

After running a quick virus scan on the machine, I notice over 100 malicious items being found. 80ish of which were located in ONE FOLDER. So, I crack open the folder to take a look, as a lot of people download malicious software without really knowing what they're getting into. 

Well, I found an entire series of photos and videos on the computer. I clicked one (stupidly) and saw a young girl (pre-adolescent) engaged in sexual activity with an adult. The others had similar file names, and were clearly pornographic videos and photos from what little I could see in the thumbnail. Honestly, I've never felt more sick to my stomach than I did last night when I saw that picture.

My mind is a mess right now. I couldn't sleep last night and I'm not really sure what to do. I took screen shots of the file system to prove that they were last modified/viewed BEFORE I received the computer as to not implicate myself in any way. 

How in the Hell am I supposed to report this?

"Hello. 

Ive been here a while and the title sums it up if you dont want to read anymore than this. You wont miss anything other than the title. I promise.

I just read a post about Kygo VR experience. Why am I making a post about a post? It reminded me that I bought Kygo, and used it once, then forgot about it because its locked into a submenu. Sony please allow a folder for all VR content. I want to turn on my Playstation and be able to see all my VR content in the same place IN A VR INTERFACE.  (This is what led me to make this post if you""re still here)

While we are at it, please add a VR theme or something for the main menu (XMB). People pay upwards of $400 for PSVR and its the same interface we have on TV only worse... Please give us a free basic (or paid) 360 3D VR theme for all PSVR owners. Something like PSVR Worlds or even the damn demo disc 

Make it feel PREMIUM!

 There are dozens of ""sub-par"" flat themes on the PSN store for a few bucks. How about you allow development of VR themes? Or do it yourself? I would get more use out of a $5 really good theme vs. a $5 game that lasts 30 minutes. Anything would be better than the stock UI Sony provides. Its immersion breaking, ugly and sloppy when I go to cinema mode. UI on a $400 upgrade should be way better. If there is one thing I will complain about since launch, thats it.

So, let creators develop! There are already indie themes on the PSN store whats the hold up? Memory? I want Sony to show that they care about PSVR and not make it right, from game to.menu. Everything, not half VR. Would it even be expensive?

 I am even ok with 180o and not full 360o. Just please consider giving developers the opprtunity to develop a better User Interface if you are not going to.

That is all thanks for reading if you made it this far. Rant is over... (For now)

"Hey folks, seeing a number of questions on how the rewards will work in Escalation Protocol so I wanted to try to clear it up a bit and get folks on the same page without people needing to stalk my Twitter timeline (which, as it is finally going to be nice in Seattle this weekend, will probably mostly be cats/beer/drone flying)

Escalation Protocol rewards are split up in to 3 main channels: vanity, weapons, and armor. Each channel operates a little bit different to give people different pursuits and provide rewards at different rates/tiers. I think the diversity of this reward delivery is something we haven't done a lot of in Destiny 2, so I'm super curious how it feels once you get your hands on it. That aside, let's jump in!

Vanity: These rewards are low drop chance, and can come out of any Escalation Protocol chest you open during the event. The further in you get, the higher chance the chest has to grant one of the EP exclusive vanity items. However, even if you can only clear up to wave 3 (the first wave that spawns a chest upon completion) then you can get a chance (admittedly very low...) at getting one of the vanity items. EP has an exclusive Ship, Sparrow, and Ghost.

Weapons: These are your grindable rewards. They don't drop as power upgrades past the soft cap (so you'll want to infuse something in to them if you're past 340) but you can spend as much time chasing them in a week as you want. They're a low drop chance from the wave 7 boss, and the reward pool changes for the different bosses. Three of the bosses have a specific weapon (between shotgun, sniper rifle, and smg) tied to them and will only drop that weapon. The other two bosses can drop any of the three weapons if you just want to grind and roll the dice. They do not come from the chests.

Armor: The armor set comes from a chest that appears after beating the wave 7 boss. This chest requires a key to open, and characters can earn one key a week by playing other Warmind activities to build and charge their key. The armor pieces that come out of the chest are awarded in a specific order, and you won't see repeats until you've collected the entire armor set. The order is Class Item -> Legs -> Arms -> Chest -> Head. (If you're wondering why Class Item is first, well, I main a Hunter. Capes for life.) The armor drops at Powerful Reward tier Power upgrades.

I should note that while not really part of one of the three main reward channels, the unique Escalation Protocol shader is one of my personal favorites (because I love orange) and comes from killing the final boss. 

Hope this clears up any confusion, and let me know if there are any other questions about EP rewards I can hopefully help with.

"Holy fucking shit i was so shocked after yesterday's patch preview...

What the fuck is it? 

**First - you nerf old dungeons rewards, why?**

You tell us to do ""new content"", but how the fuck new players are gonna pug Ransacked Treasury or Drowning deeps? Like for real if i was owning this company i would kick all these shitty devs because they don't even know what's going on in game. New players will lose interest in a game even faster because who wants baleful player with square gems and solak accessories in their RT party?

**Second - Accessory reductions costs jebaited us**

Earlier this week you guys announced accessories costs reductions and everyone was so hyped. ""Oh, maybe i can finally max my VT neck"" nope. Reductions is for non-raid path only, but you forgot that nobody uses non-raid accessories... ""How am i supposed to farm 1200 moonstone crystals for neck when the price is for 1 moonstone is 9g? Farm Naksun? Guys, you just told me to do ""new content"" Jebaited""

**Third - no additional moonstone/moonstone crystals source**

No comment on it. Disappointed.

**Fourth - New daily challenge chest is shit**

Less tradable materials, yeah good job. Can't wait to see PTS in F10 again so you can milk players even more, fuck economy. 

For fuck sake, just listen to players since you don't even play this game. You greedy apes, all what you care about is money and new RNG Box proves it perfectly - New oils and BLOOD PEARLS inside so whales can grab their Dragon Souls day 1 and avoid farming. Same with the EXP Charms, i was saying multiple times 5M Charms should have 24H cooldown since the beginning, now when they milked all the whales for their HM levels they suddenly put 24H cd on charms!

I am really disappointed in current state of this game, i am fully maxed player but if i had to start playing in BnS at this moment i would say ""No, thank you"".

And when i talk about devs i don't mean Babbletr0n or Liinxy, personally i think they are doing good job, but sadly they don't have big impact on in-game changes or economy since KR Devs decide about everything and this sucks... 

But yea... there are positive changes still. Like - ncsoft finally removed Pet packs from 5M Charms and added cooldown on it, people can get basically free critical souls through new event and more...

"Hey what's up Vault Hunters, Koby here.

Some people here probably already know me as one of the UCP (Unofficial Communiy Patch) Devs and the guy behind the BL2 Reborn modpack. Since the Borderlands 2 & TPS modding scene seems to bloom up once again thanks to the wonderful content creators like Derch I felt like clearing up some things which are commonly mistaken and I want to give some insights on Borderlands 2 & TPS modding.

Before I start elaborating stuff, I want to make clear that **none of this is official** and this is **only for the PC versions of Borderlands 2 & TPS**. Any of the following will **never hit the console versions, even if we wanted to.** Sorry console players.

1. The **UCP (Unofficial Community Patch)** is a mod/patch made by  around a dozen of Borderlands 2 community members, with Shadowevil being the author and mastermind behind Borderlands 2 modding. The UCP tries to rebalance previously underused and underpowered gear and skills to fit more into the metagame and tries to add more variety to the gameplay in addition to dozens of Quality of Life and Loot changes. [**Shadowevil's latest video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcsMrAceKjQ) has all relevant information (including changelog, download and further information) in the video description. The latest version is **4.0.17** and as it stands for now, no further updates will be released. This is our non-profit hobby and we're using up our free time working on the UCP and we reached the point where further changes would violate the vanilla feeling of the game too much.
2. **BL2 Reborn** is a modpack built by me which builds on top of the UCP (meaning the UCP is included in BL2 Reborn) and then reworks almost everything in the game in some matter (most Weapons and Items in the game are completely replaced with different gear or changed, as well as gameplay mechanics and difficulty and some skill trees). The content of BL2 Reborn is **not** my own work, around least 90% of BL2 Reborn consists of mods by the community which I feature in my modpack with the author's permissions. BL2 Reborn intends to make the game harder to a certain degree and give you a fresh experience with completely new builds and playstyles and give back the feeling of exploring the game, its mechanics and the loot. All information needed for BL2 Reborn can be found on the official BLCM Github [**right here.**](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Koby/Modpacks/BL2Reborn)
3. **FFYLands 2** by Hemaxhu is a complete overhaul for Borderlands 2 which reworks the combat flow, characters and gear of the game. It's highly recommended to play this mod together with friends because the difficulty ramps up extremely fast. The mod is mostly finished and all information is once again found on the BLCM Github [**right here.**](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Fight%20For%20Your%20Life%20Lands%202)
4. **Borderlands 2.5** is a complete overhaul for Borderlands 2 which has similar intentions as BL2 Reborn, but a lot more in-depth and professionally made. The main authors here are B33PB00PJOE and Mike (as far as I know, if I forgot somebody please let me know!) and the overhaul mod is still in development. [**Derch made a video featuring Maya's new skill trees and some of the new gameplay, go ahead and check it out!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1mZ2qvhpZ4)

In general, any of these modpacks are not intended to be used together but can be used to build on. Now, if you want to get into the Borderlands 2 & TPS modding scene I can only once again recommend you to check out the [**BLCM Github**](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods) and its [**Wiki**](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki). 

I usually only lurk on the Borderlands Subreddits and I don't post that much in general on Reddit, but if you have any further questions towards the Borderlands 2 & TPS modding scene ([**which aren't troubleshooting, we have an FAQ for that**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17bwfQXWavBDiQuthxueXbRzB7LIx37Ki1a4-P-0qBW8/)), go ahead and ask!

Am stat cu mama si sper ca am resusit sa fac sa fie cat mai confortabil pentru ea in momentele alea... ma auda, sa ma simta langa ea. Si mai stiu ca mi-ati spus, ca sigur am prieteni chiar daca ma simt singur si asa a fost. In secunda 2 au fost langa mine!

Va multumesc din suflet pentru sfaturi, ajutor si tot. 
E greu acum, enorm de greu din toate punctele de vedere, dar trebuie sa merg inainte, chiar daca asa... singur.
Incerc sa ma tin ocupat cu ce pot si cat pot acum.

"EDIT: I want to add an apology to Asterios for bringing up the bar nonsense. It was basically just a normal night and it was stupid for me to bring it up. I dont want people to overthink it because it was silly and probably sounds worse than what really happened. Obviously I was being angry and it was unfair, so again I apologize.


I realized that we are arguing over things that aren't even related to the lawsuit or the show anymore.

We kind of just walked into arguing with each other for the sake of arguing.

So I'll just own up right now and say I'm being dumb.

I think a lot of my arguments are just based on being emotionally invested in arguing and not really accomplishing anything.

So lets start over.

I'm going to take a look at the suit and read through the complaints and get up to date.

Send me any info to tim@tagg.ly

I apologize for saying dumb shit and leading anyone to believe story merit was based on followers or trends.

There is no point is trying to argue because you guys know way more about what is going on than I do so I'll just let up the emotional defense and start listening to what you guys have to say.

Feel free to keep trashing me or whatever.

But let me use this post to just say definitively that I'm not going to argue for no reason or keep being emotional because it wont do anything for me and wont resolve anything with the lawsuit.

Best of luck to you guys and to TDS.

"Greetings runners! Sorry about not getting out a Spotlight last week. First time in a long long long time I've not gotten one posted. It was a rather hectic week to say the least. But, we're back on track and ready to rock and roll. This week we've got ourselves another fresh new face who's ready to share a bit more about what makes this runner run! So let's get to it and find out a bit more about this week's featured athlete. Ladies and gents, give it up for /u/maxillz23!

Let's do this...

_____
_____

###**The Runner:**

**First name?**

> Max

**Age?**

> 25

**Where are you from?**

> Savoy, IL

**Occupation?**

> Graduate Student - Food Microbiology

_____
_____

###**Running Q&A's:**

**What are your PR's?**

> 1 mi - 5:15 

> 5k - 18:00 

> half marathon - 1:32:some change

> marathon - 4:16: some more change

**What is your distance PR?**

> ~26.2 miles currently. 

**What's your highest weekly recorded milage?**

> 48 miles

**What's your comfy pace?**

> 9:30 to 10:00 

**How long have you been running?**

> I started running cross country in the 7th grade and continued to do so throughout high school. I played soccer during college and took a break from running up until a few years ago.

**Tell us why you began running?**

> I picked up running again because graduate school was wearing on me and I needed a hobby to keep me mentally sane. It helps that the Illinois marathon is a local race that gave me something to train for. 

**Most memorable running moment?**

> My first half marathon (Des Moines, IA) was pretty great. The weather ended up being pretty gloomy but it was a fun race overall. 
> 
> 

**Do you have a running mantra?**

> ""I'm happy, I'm healthy, I feel terrific. It's a great day to run."" which is what my high school cross country coach would have us repeat back to him when the weather wasn't always cooperating or the team needed a pick me up. 
> 
> Recently I've also been using, ""They ain't giving it, I'm taking it""

**What time of day do you prefer to run?**

> Mornings. I don't know how people have the motivation to go for their runs after a day of work. It also just helps me prepare for the day. Plenty of time to think about how I am going to tackle the day. 

**Any big races coming up?**

> I guess I'm signed up for Eagle Up. I am pretty excited for that. 

**What are your short-term running goals?**

> Up my weekly mileage, and become more comfortable with a higher weekly mileage. Training for EU has definitely helped, and I hope I can keep up the mileage through the rest of the year. 

**What are your long-term running goals?**

> I'd like to tackle a 100 mi race some day. That's probably a couple years off, at minimum, though. I'd also like to get more trail running in. 

**What's one piece of running advice you‚Äôd give to the younger version of yourself?**

> You don't have to push yourself through injuries. It's okay to listen to your body and rest. 

**What is something you need to work on to become a better runner?**

> Nutrition and overall strength. I tried to incorporate more ab workouts into my routine, but I have fallen off of the wagon. I need to keep up with those. 

**What is your current shoe choice?**

> Nike Zoom Fly, Adidas Boston 6, and I just picked up a pair of Altra's...but I can't remember which model. 

**Trail? Road? Track? Or Treadmill?**

> Road is my preference, but I like the trail and track. I abhor the treadmill. 

**What is your ideal running weather?**

> 50 degrees and a slight breeze. 

**Do you have any social media accounts you‚Äôd like to share? [Facebook, Strava, Twitter]**

###**Just For Fun:**

**What‚Äôs your spirit animal?**

> I'd like to think it's a fox, but that's probably bias. Cunning and fleet footed. Also adorable. 

**What hobbies and interests do you have besides running?**

> I love to play board games and video games. Excited to play two new board games I just picked up, Photosynthesis and Steam Park.  I do some light baking every now and then. 

**Do you have any hidden talents?**

> If I do, it's very well hidden. 

**Biggest pet peeve?**

> I hate when I am running with a group and a person starts to push the pace past what was sort of agreed on. I especially hate this when it's clear that not everyone in the group will be able to hold that pace for the rest of the run.
> 
> Also, frivolous meetings.

**Dream job! What would it be?**

> A tenured professor at a smaller college. Research is fun, but I enjoy teaching. 
> 
> Or will someone pay me to just hang out? Play video games casually or just be a science consultan, maybe?. Pizza taste tester? 
> 
> 

**Favorite Quote or Poem?**

> ""The world does not owe you anything""
> 
> ""The weather outside is weather""
> 
> ""Always be closing"" - Glengarry Glen Ross

**What is your favorite movie?**

> Always tough to say. I do have a ridiculous love for the Mighty Ducks 2. 

**What is your biggest character flaw?**

> I can sometimes be a workaholic or sometimes be too quick too quick to give advice. 

**What songs have you been listening to recently?**

> Whiskey Drink - The Lonesome Trio (Bluegrass group from ""The Office"" actor Ed Helms)

**What are some of your favorite non-running subreddits?**

> r/NBA 

> r/BreadIt

> r/Labrats

_____
_____

###**One Last Question:**

**What is the origin of your username?**

> when I was younger someone made a joke about me being ""maxmillz"" and so I adopted that as my username for videogames and such. Then when I went to create my reddit account I misspelled the name by dropping an m so on here it's maxillz, but it gets the job done.

"I‚Äôm a straight guy, hope you bros don‚Äôt mind me asking for advice - long story short I‚Äôm starting to worry that my boyfriend may be gay.

My name‚Äôs Jon. Using my gay friends account to post this. I don‚Äôt have anything against gay guys. A lot are really hot. I just identify as straight, so does my boyfriend - who I‚Äôll call Sam. We‚Äôre both straight acting ( because we are straight). Also, we‚Äôre not gay.

I look like a young Bill Clinton and he looks like a young George W. Bush. I don‚Äôt know which one of us would run as Vice Prez if we decide to run. We‚Äôre not 100% that we‚Äôre gonna run anyway.

The problem is I‚Äôm starting to worry Sam could be gay. Last weekend we were in a coffee shop and something about the way he was drinking his flat white was just really gay. He was looking at a guy‚Äôs ass. Then he said ‚Äòthat guy‚Äôs hot‚Äô. And something about the way he said it just seemed really gay to me. I agreed that the guy was hot ( he was) but inside......inside I was worried.

I wondered if he could be...but we‚Äôve discussed this. We‚Äôre both straight and agreed to have a straight relationship.

Another time we were fucking, and when he was on top of me he just seemed really gay for some reason. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was hot, it was amazing like usual. But then afterwards we were all sweaty and feeling good and he said ‚Äúthat was so good‚Äù.

The way he used the word ‚Äòso‚Äô... that was ‚Äòso good‚Äô. Not just ‚Äògood‚Äô but ‚Äòso good‚Äô. I thought we were having straight sex. ‚ÄòSo good‚Äô. Do you think he could be gay? He‚Äôs always liked action movies and beer and lifting things, which I don‚Äôt think gay guys like. I thought I was dating a straight guy, just like me. ( I have nothing against gay or bi guys by the way).

But now I‚Äôm beginning to feel like our whole relationship is built on a bed of lies. Could it have become gay without me even realising it? Could he have become gay? Why do things have to change? Why did we both find Thor really hot in Avengers 3?

Then something happened the other day, we were having coffee. Both in a straight way.  It was a beautiful day. Then he turned to me and said, ‚Äúcall me crazy, but are you gay?‚Äù

"‚ÄòWhat in the Throne‚Äôs name were you two idiots thinking?‚Äô

Captain Atheus of the Eighth Company stood at the heart of the Ultramarines command hub, a bombed-out dome that had likely once housed a xenos dignitary. Numitor and Sicarius could not see their superior officer‚Äôs expression, but his stance left them in no doubt as to his mood. He looked as if he was about to lash out, and given the rumours of Atheus‚Äô volatile temper, that might well be the case.

‚ÄòLord Executioner,‚Äô said Sicarius, ‚Äòwe dispersed as per your orders, and made use of an opportunity to strike at the heart of the xenos military.‚Äô

‚ÄòYou left half your squad behind, Sergeant Sicarius!‚Äô shouted Atheus. ‚ÄòAnd don‚Äôt pretend you two had any idea of where that transmotive was headed. Four battle-brothers died as a direct result of your actions. I had to divert a Thunderhawk gunship to unite your squad! The Sword of Calth, no less!‚Äô

‚ÄòIt was an unforgivable lapse of judgement,‚Äô said Numitor, his eyes cast down, ‚Äòon both our parts. Although‚Ä¶‚Äô

Numitor left the word hanging for a moment.

‚ÄòSergeant Numitor,‚Äô growled Atheus, ‚ÄòDo not try my patience further. If you have something to say, say it.‚Äô

‚ÄòAlthough we acted rashly,‚Äô continued Numitor, ‚Äòwe had a chance to assassinate a key member of their war council. In that, we may have succeeded.‚Äô

‚ÄòGo on,‚Äô said Atheus.

‚ÄòYes,‚Äô interrupted Sicarius before Numitor could answer. ‚ÄòThis one.‚Äô He drew his combat knife and threw it end over end across the ruined plaza. It struck one of the xenos propaganda hololiths, tip embedded in the wall behind ‚Äì an image of a tall tau warrior standing proud before a giant red battlesuit. ‚ÄòA commander hero of their warrior caste,‚Äô continued Sicarius. ‚ÄòHe is called Farsight I believe. We hounded him to the point of death.‚Äô

‚ÄòI know of that one all too well,‚Äô said Atheus. ‚ÄòPict-capture footage of his triumphs is projected on the clouds every night. These xenos are fond of telling themselves they are strong.‚Äô

Whilst Atheus‚Äô attention was on the hololith, Numitor scowled at Sicarius, but did not contradict his claim.

‚ÄòBut you do not have his corpse as proof,‚Äô said Atheus, his tone as thin and sharp as razorwire as he turned back to the sergeants. ‚ÄòNor do you have any data to verify your words.‚Äô

Neither Numitor or Sicarius was foolish enough to reply.

‚ÄòYou are over-fond of dramatic gestures, Sergeant Sicarius, and one day they will get you killed. Right this moment, I would consider that a fitting justice.‚Äô

The sergeants kept their peace.

‚ÄòRetrieve your combat knife, sergeant. Then you will reunite with your squads, both of you.‚Äô

‚ÄòOf course,‚Äô said Numitor. ‚ÄòWe will make all haste.‚Äô

‚ÄòBring me the corpse of this xenos war hero, and I shall consider your chosen course exonerated. Otherwise, you will act as honour and penitence dictate at all times. Is that clear?‚Äô

Both sergeants made the sign of the aquila. ‚ÄòAye, Lord Atheus.‚Äô

A Space Marine with weathered brown skin and six service studs in his forehead crunched through the rubble towards the Lord Executioner.

‚ÄòEnitor, well met,‚Äô said Atheus, turning away from the sergeants. ‚ÄòReport.‚Äô

‚ÄòMy lord, we have had word from the Iron Hands. Tau heavy elements are inbound on this position.‚Äô

‚ÄòUnderstood,‚Äô said Atheus. ‚ÄòDisperse and engage. And sergeants,‚Äô said the captain, looking back to Numitor and Sicarius, ‚Äòdo not lead your men astray from the Codex‚Äôs teachings in your next engagement, or I shall ensure it is the last time you do so.‚Äô",False,0,False,"[Book Excerpt|Blades of Damocles] A young Cato Sicarius is scolded for breaking the Codex Astartes","r/40kLore",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gx6kc",False,"dark","public",86,"self.40kLore","",False,False,False,86,"self",False,True,"text",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2zdqr","8gx6kc",0,13,True,"/r/40kLore/comments/8gx6kc/book_excerptblades_of_damocles_a_young_cato/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/8gx6kc/book_excerptblades_of_damocles_a_young_cato/",30373,False,False,2048,"best"

"This is a tale of what rightfully should have been a 3 hour day, nice tip in the pocket and that would have been that. But sadly, this was not that.

It was a Saturday morning at 6:30am as we opened the store super early for a 250 pizza order that was due at 9am. 250 pies spread out across many different specialties and two topping combinations. Typical warehouse lunch for a large crew on a Saturday. My GM, one insider, another driver and myself blazed through the prep, building, and logistics phase with no issues. We were all veterans of this store, and were a well oiled machine. 

A couple hours later, we're packing our two cars with the last few hot bags and gathering the accouterments one would normally take - Plates, CRP, Parm, etc and getting ready to hit the road. 

As I climbed into the driver seat of my 2004 Tiburon GT, attempting to see through the steamed up windows, I did my final check for a pen, the receipt and ensured we had the address correct. Everything was golden and I led the way, our other driver in tow with our vehicles maxed out, carrying 2/3 of the order. A second trip for one of us was of no consequence given the distance back to the store and the time it would take to set up the first wave in a customer friendly manner. 

We arrived, and began unloading our vehicles, focusing first on the other driver as he was slated to make the run for the last bit of the order. As we get the last of the pizzas unloaded from the cars, we touch base and as he takes off to the store to get the remaining pies, I finish up with the staging. 

Oh the staging - and let me say that everything we did from the beginning of the morning until now was to allow this to happen smoothly; it was a logistical masterpiece. Any veteran driver knows what I am talking about, but with 15 different types of pizza and all kinds of sides, drinks etc... you have to work these like your catering. Everything sorted by type, in a way that works with a line of people; standard stuff. 

The point is, this was a clinic in the art of the large delivery order.


The other drive arrives back with the remaining pizzas and we get them set up, allowing the client to open the doors to their lunch event 5 minutes early. As we were waiting for the lady in charge to come over to sign for everything, we looked at one another with absolute confidence that we were going to do very well. 

$1700 ticket, with an amazing customer experience from front to back? Surely this was in the bag. 

She walks up and very pleasantly asked, ""Hey guys! Thanks so much, do you have anything for me to fill out?"" 


I hand over the paperwork, uncapped pen on top, oriented so that it was facing her. This so that she would have to expend minimal effort to sign the receipt. 


""We just need the top one, the bottom two are for you, ma'am."" I said, as I had a thousand times before.


She smiles and signs the receipt, folding it in half before handing it back. Classy move, I respect it. 


As I thank her and turn to leave, I meet my compatriot at the door as he finishes loading the empty hot-bags into our cars.


We wait until the door shuts behind us and unfold the slip to see how the gods were smiling upon us. After all, it was now ~10am on a Saturday and we were both looking forward to having the rest of the day off with a nice chunk of change in our respective pockets.

You know on cheesy sitcoms, something crazy happens and you hear that record stop sound. That's exactly what happened, everything stopped as we gazed at not only....a normal zero in that tip line. It was the dreaded zero WITH the slash through it. Complete with a ""Thank you! :)"" written off to the side. 


We return back to the store, livid as one would expect. Our GM and insider were finishing up cleaning and getting ready to open for actual business stop what they were doing to ask us what the hell happened. I suppose it was written on our faces. 


Our manager, was also super pissed. He ended up giving us each ~15 % on that ticket out of his own pocket and then he also refused to do orders before business hours for that place for the remainder of the time that store was open. He also gave us the rest of the day off. 


All in all, it was a pretty good day.


TL;DR - got stiffed on a $1700 order outside of business hours, on a corporate card and my boss ended up hooking us up out of his pocket.

"Hi everyone,

I'm a first year medicine resident.  I was moving out of my rental unit (which are owned condos by private owners - leased by a leasing company) when a box I left on the stove must have hooked a button and ignited.  The box wasn't a huge issue as it was easy to put out - but the sprinkler system started and flooded the fourth floor unit.

I stayed longer than my lease (by 19 days) as the owner had no one moving in and I could take my time to move out.  The problem with all this is that I did not have tenant insurance covering me during this time.  The original lease does state that I need tenant insurance, and I verbally agreed to stay longer in the unit - despite not resigning. My new apartment's insurance only kicked in midnight of that night (the incident happened at 8 pm).  

So far I've received 5 different letters from insurance company (the unit itself, the neighbouring units, the units downstairs and the condo building itself) detailing that they are summing up the costs.  So far I've only heard from the unit beside mine - which was roughly 6000$ and they only had wet floors.  I know my unit and the unit below needs a complete reno due to the water damage which I'm sure will total in the 100Ks.

Seeing how I'm a first year medical resident I make roughly 42K/year.  Due to a separation with my wife, medical school, conferences, etc etc, I also have an impressive amount of debt.  My student line of credit is currently at 250K/275K and I owe roughly 40K to government student loans.

What are my financial options at this point?  If each insurance company comes after me for their total, there is no way I can afford that, seeing how I can't really afford the renovations of the least damaged unit.  The first unit is threatening to go to collections if I don't pay the 6000$ in 30 days, although we haven't been to court so I'm not sure how they can send me to collections without having established that I actually owe them that money...
 
I realize the consensus is that 'someday' I will make more money than 42K as a physician, but the stress and weight of all this has made my residency very difficult and I have since failed a rotation - which makes my future as a physician not a guarantee...

"More of a shower thought than anything... but I think Christians who talk about eternal conscious torment like it's no big deal have never truly experienced real torture - physical or emotional. I was in a relationship with a woman for several years who lived daily with some extreme emotional issues. Just living was torture for her, so told me she frequently contemplated suicide just to feel some peace. She also wasn't a Christian. It definitely was something that led to my deconversion - seeing this woman I loved being in tremendous pain... and then thinking whatever pain she was feeling now would be multiplied by a billion? And never ending. No, that just seemed too cruel; if there was a God that did that to someone who was dealt a rough hand, I didn't want any part of it.

Same for physical tormet. I've only ever felt real physical pain for maybe a second or two at a time. But I knew a guy who got pretty badly burned growing up. Even as an adult, he really didn't want to talk about it, but just said it was a kind of pain you couldn't imagine.

So yeah, I tend to think most Christians who don't bat an eye about eternal torment have lived sheltered lives where actual torment is something they can't even grasp. If they did, they might rethink their views.

TL;DR those who talk about the fires of he'll have probably never been burned before.",False,0,False,"Christians who believe in eternal torment have never experienced what torture actually feels like","r/exchristian",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gwbwa",False,"dark","public",139,"self.exchristian","",False,False,False,139,"self",False,True,"richtext",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2r95q","8gwbwa",0,43,True,"/r/exchristian/comments/8gwbwa/christians_who_believe_in_eternal_torment_have/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/8gwbwa/christians_who_believe_in_eternal_torment_have/",24745,False,False,2048,"best"

##Eleven months prior

Vacca saw her reflection in the glass coffin. For a moment, it seemed as if it was her lying inside of it. The woman with a thousand scars on her face, each one painfully self-inflicted. Carvings, she had called them. And she could still feel the bite of the blade as she had dragged it over her skin and cut away chunks of flesh. As her face changed from that of her sister's, to something new. Something unique.

She almost laughed at the memory: as if identity could ever be worn, and wasn't something fundamental. Something ingrained.

It wasn't her in the coffin, of course. It was a man whom she didn't recognise. His eyes were open, and although his skin was pale, he looked so...

""Is he alive?"" Vacca asked.

Heather frowned at her. ""He's been lying in there since... since before we awoke maybe. I'm pretty sure he's dead.""

They had found the room accidentally. A small underground chamber, its metal roof covered in sand to blend in with the desert above. Only the metal had rusted. Years of rain and storms had weakened the already thin layer of steel. All it had taken were two people walking hand in hand over it, for it to collapse. 

There were a dozen or so monitors placed around the largest room, and in that respect it reminded Vacca of the main facility. Where they had been created. Not that any of the monitors here still worked. She wondered what they had once broadcast.

This mini-facility only had three rooms total. A bathroom, the main living area, and a large storage room with plenty of canned food and bottled water. 

The single glass coffin that lay on the side of the main room, was exactly like the four coffins back in the facility. 

But to the side of this coffin, the skeleton of a woman lay on the floor, her arms folded across her shoulders.

Electricity still flowed into the chamber. Into the coffin. Just like the facility, it seemed to have its own unseen power source. Perhaps they could trace it... Use it.

Words were scrawled on the walls of the room in a faded orange. Vacca knew they had once been a vivid red.

> Forgive me? Forgive me? Forgive me?

""Who do you think he was?"" Heather asked.

Vacca turned to her and cocked her head. ""You've not worked it out?""

Heather frowned. ""You know? Who is it?""

""*God.*""

‚ñ¨‚ñ¨

The old man had frozen himself in the coffin. Perhaps it had been suicide, or perhaps he had known he was going to die anyway.  Yes, he was dead and they couldn't bring him back, but his brain had not rotted. Those patterns within it, the patterns unique to each living person, they could perhaps be saved. More than the patterns -- his memories.  

With all the technology they had in the facility... there must be a way to do it. And if there was a way, she would find it.

This would be Vacca's redemption. Her gift to the colony.

Perhaps she could have been a leader to the clones like Kay had been, if she'd had a fair chance. Only she would have made a better leader, because unlike the rest of the colony, Vacca had been able to see Kay's mistakes from the start.

Kay had become arrogant so damn quickly. It wasn't the power itself that had corrupted her, but the colonists. ""She's not let us down before,"" or ""Life's not been bad under Kay's leadership."" They always supported her, always believed in her. And it got to Kay. She began to think that her every decision was correct. That a challenge to her ideals was a nothing more than a petty joust of personalities. But she was wrong. Vacca knew that things could be *better* than they were. Why couldn't anyone else see that -- why were they happy to settle for what they had?

It wasn't until the world had become dark and broken, that some colonists finally lost faith in Kay. That they were willing to at least listen to Vacca.

The promises Vacca had made them had been reasonable: to reunite the colony; to restart farming, indoors this time; to introduce harsher laws for criminals. But it had all been too late. The cracks in the colony had already become gaping holes by the time she had formally taken charge. And the harder she tried to plug them, the more of them that sprang up. What was left of the colony, what final embers of hope that there had been when she'd taken charge, soon flittered away into the night.

And as always, she had been blamed.

But this man, this ghost, would redeem her.

Extracting his DNA and creating the first clone had been the easy part. Finding out the skeleton of the woman lying next to him had been another Vacca. Another Kay. That had been a little harder.

The man on the other hand, he was someone new. Never before cloned. 

The coffins were meant to do the more complex tasks automatically. The waves, the patterns and the alterations. They could feed information in via the terminals. In theory, it should have been possible to take a snapshot of the man's brain, and to implant its coding into a clone. 

In practice, it just didn't work. Those clones that did wake (and they were the rare ones), didn't have memories. 

Or perhaps they did, and they just couldn't access them.

And so they moved on. They tried to stimulate the clones' memories, by introducing them to people the real him might have known in life. Other clones, including the woman who lay dead by his coffin. 

And when those clones failed, Vacca had no choice but to destroy them. The world couldn't support hundreds, or possibly thousands more clones. 

Every time they created *him*, they tweaked his brain here or there. Randomised growth patterns. Changed the binding of his neural network. No two versions of him were ever alike. 

And that was fine, they only needed one. 

One who could remember.

"I just saw a vicious dog attack at bird park because of irresponsible dog ownership. I go to bird park frequently, there are often dogs off-leash, and I've never seen any problems beyond a little barking and ass sniffing. Today was different. 

A small dog (<20 lbs) was off-leash near me and had been roaming around the grass for a while, approaching some other people and other dogs but with no problems and the owner being attentive to it throughout. Out of nowhere a large white pit bull comes running across the grass and begins barking and circling the smaller dog. Within seconds the pit bull had the smaller dog in its jaw pinned to the ground while both their owners ran to try and separate them to no avail. 

Finally, the pit was able to be removed, but the owner was incapable of controlling their dog and was being dragged across the grass while holding onto it as it tried to re-attack the bleeding smaller dog. Some others ran over to help and the pitbull was able to be leashed and brought to a car while the smaller dog had pressure applied to the wounds and was taken to the vet and I think will be OK. 

The lesson here is, DO NOT JUST LET YOUR DOG LOOSE IN A PUBLIC AREA!!!!!! Dogs need to acclimate to their surroundings, especially when its a highly frequented area with people, children, and other dogs around. I understand San Diego is a great dog-friendly city and I love that about this area, but please do your research, be able to control your dog, and understand that even a dog who has never exhibited aggressive behavior before can do so in an instance when confronted with a new environment or surroundings. Never assume your dog will behave in a certain way.

"I don't believe the redesign should be attempting to roll out to all users. It has been stated multiple times that it's not feature complete by the admins. There are plenty of bugs. There's too much going on in the frontend to worry about server load this early on in the project.

Plenty of communities rely on certain features which are not yet available. Having new users attempt to view these communities without the full feature set gives them a rather gimped experience and could affect their return. The bugs and lack of certain features _will_ affect the return rate of new users, and are already affecting the old users at this point.

No other site I've ever seen rolled out a redesign or major update without having it be completely feature complete first. Yes, sites like Youtube and Facebook have had backlash on their redesigns, but it was primarily about the aesthetic, not so much about the functions. 

Reddit isn't even at the halfway point in their feature list and want to roll it out to all users as-is. This redesign should have been _much_ farther along before it hit the alpha, which should have been used to figure out what features were missing and which were unneeded. During the beta, it should have been primarily bug fixes and small changes to existing features (with new features being added rarely but as needed). We should not be near the release point at all.

It's making the reddit devs look lazy, uncaring, and implies they lack proper deployment planning. The first two may not be true, but the third certainly is. A proper release schedule needs to be made, with specific points in development during which to add more users.

"Just over a year ago, I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/67fgr5/fianc%C3%A9e_31_m_of_6_years_left_me_26_f_3_weeks/ 

It was just three weeks before my wedding day, I came home and my fiancee had told me he had packed all his things and was leaving. No wedding, no future. In ten minutes my whole life changed.

I was destroyed. It felt like physical pain at first, like I could never continue with normal life again. 

This sub was my life buoy. I sorted all the posts by ""Top"" and ""All Time"" and read and re-read them. It was the only respite for me in a time when every thought was like a dagger.

Just over a year later I look back on my past life and don't recognize myself. I no longer feel that intense longing to be with my ex anymore. In fact, I realize that I dodged a bullet. He had the gall to email me on New Year's Eve and say ""Happy New Year, I hope you have a good year"" and I felt no qualms in deleting it and blocking his last way to contact me. I never thought I would get to that point.

Since that awful day, I moved to a new country, got a job in a company that I never thought I'd work for, and I have begun dating again. Everything feels lighter now, having felt such pain.  

I sometimes wonder what I would tell myself last year, knowing what I know now. And I find myself repeating the advice that I got here. For anyone who has felt the fresh sting of a breakup, listen to the people on this sub. Go no contact, focus on yourself, realize that the fact that they even broke up with you means that they (not you) are not worth it.

Then design the encounters accordingly knowing that the party would have had opportunities to research and prepare beyond their normal character abilities.

I find that most approach Pathfinder with a disdain for consumables. Since this is often viewed as a waste of money. Gold that could've gone into permanent items is now consumed.

There are a lot of great items that could see usage but never are because of this.

We called the police and they said they were already after them. Just then a helicopter and several other police vehicles started circling the parking lot.

"It's Friday and almost the weekend, so an easy read today. It's the little things in life that count like manners. For more see: [https://realtimecrm.co.uk/posts/rules\-for\-life\-\-business\-\-\-be\-nice\-you\-never\-know\-who\-youll\-meet/](https://realtimecrm.co.uk/posts/rules-for-life--business---be-nice-you-never-know-who-youll-meet/)

Long before I started RealtimeCRM I was about to step inside a huge corporate building to make a sales pitch. It was to a prospective client who was big, this account if I‚Äôd get it would change things.

So I stepped into the building and headed over to the reception and let them know what I was there for. They ushered me over to the waiting area where there were a few people sitting including one conspicuous person separate from the others.

He was a dishevelled looking man, his clothes were dirty, tardy and torn and he was sitting legs splayed across the chair, snorting his nose and generally being the opposite of a well mannered individual.

I took no mind of this and sat opposite him and smiled. After I had taken my seat I went through in my head the pitch I had prepared that I was going to perform but I was interrupted by the man opposite me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôchu here for then?‚Äù he interjected.

I replied that I was here for a sales pitch for my company and as I was explaining what my company was he interrupted again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a cleaner! ‚Äòere for a cleaning job‚Äù he proclaimed so that everyone could hear. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôdyu think I should say?‚Äù

I replied he should just be himself, show that he‚Äôs a hard worker, honest and that he could be the best cleaner they could possibly hire. Talk about the other cleaning jobs he‚Äôs had.

We continued with our conversation with him asking me more about what I do. Trying to simplify what we did, I explained that I looked after computers and fixed them when they went wrong. He told me that he did not understand computers but had played some games on one a long time ago.

Then the person I was waiting for came down the stairs in a smart suit and asked for me. I got up and shook his hand and we started to walk down the corridor to his office. While walking he smiled at me and said ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôve met our owner. He is not around much these days‚Äù.

I looked around confused as I didn‚Äôt think I had but the smartly dressed man smiled and pointed back to the dishevelled man, that‚Äôs our owner.

The next morning I received a phone call with the good news that I had won the contract. To this day, I still do not know if I won the contract because of my skills or my brief conversation with the so called cleaner!",False,0,False,"Rules for life & business - Be nice, you never know who you'll meet","r/smallbusiness",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gyjv9",False,"dark","public",30,"self.smallbusiness","",False,False,False,30,"self",False,"self",True,"text",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"richtext",False,"t5_2qr34","8gyjv9",0,7,True,"/r/smallbusiness/comments/8gyjv9/rules_for_life_business_be_nice_you_never_know/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/8gyjv9/rules_for_life_business_be_nice_you_never_know/",120587,False,False,2048,"best"

It seems like something out of a dystopian novel, but this is our life now! I see that sinister, damning phrase everywhere I look. Women have been erased. It's just men and everyone who chooses not to identify as a man. Men are excused from sexism because they're not men, they're non-binary or genderqueer or ""women."" 
I am a woman, but I have to call myself cis or non-male or uterus-bearer.
I am female, but I'm not allowed to discuss my body because it might make someone else uncomfortable.
I am a lesbian, but I have to call myself queer or ""an LGBT,"" and I'm not allowed to have sexual boundaries.

"In 2012 I started my Crossfit Journey.  About 6 months in I set a laundry list of goals for myself that I wanted to do ranging from running a mile in under 9 minutes (my body doesn't move fast) to getting pullups, squatting/DL 400+ etc.  That winter I had to relocate for work and leave my box, did some shopping around in the new area and after a few months at a new box I lost interested and it wasn't feeling good.  I moved again last year and found a box that I love and got back into it.  
  
This week we did squat snatch singles and I finally hit the 185# that I have coveted back then which ended up being about a 20-30 lb PR (I really wanted it).  Just wanted to share this how awesome it still feels to hit a goal that I set in my 'younger days' 6 years later.

"I realize this is a little bit off topic for this sub, but I thought it was some pretty important information. I'm not sure if people were aware but just the other day police in Dallas arrested an individual who was in the late planning stages for [a mass shooting at the local mall](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Frisco-Student-Was-Inspired-by-Islamic-State-to-Carry-Out-Attack-at-Stonebriar-Mall-481509921.html). Apparently he was inspired by the Islamic State, and strongly desired to commit his own terrorist attack.

Aside from the fact that he said some extremely strange [things](https://i.imgur.com/fVZ8tB8.jpg) to the police, some very interesting information can be pulled from the [arrest affidavit](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Frisco-Student-Was-Inspired-by-Islamic-State-to-Carry-Out-Attack-at-Stonebriar-Mall-481509921.html#affidavitrs).

Apparently the suspect and an undercover officer, who initially discovered the plot, were discussing things like location and target selection.


> They discussed the ""possibility that patrons in the mall could be carrying concealed weapons, and could draw those weapons when the operations begins""

>To which the suspect says he didn't think a police officer would ""try and take us on"" and noted the Parkland, Florida shooing and says the security officer at the school ""ran outside...a lot of people are mad at him""

I'm sure this kind of thinking won't be shocking to a lot of people here, considering that most of us know that the overwhelming majority of mass shootings take place in gun-free zones (80-90%), and that the police were rarely if ever be there in time to make a difference. But I found it very interesting how an actual attacker, especially one so young, would so directly articulate that to someone, and how they can be influenced by an event that occurred just a couple months ago (Browsed county shooting an police response). I think it just goes to show that if a 17 year old college student can recognize this, it's pretty hard for anti-gun activists to keep pushing the line that murderers aren't actively looking for soft targets.",False,0,False,"The suspect in the recent planned mass shooting was more concerned about CCWers than the police.","r/CCW",False,1,0,"","promo_specified",False,"t3_8gtveq",False,"dark","public",381,"self.CCW","",False,False,False,381,"self",False,"self",True,"richtext",1,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"markdown",False,"t5_2s4mc","8gtveq",0,94,True,"/r/CCW/comments/8gtveq/the_suspect_in_the_recent_planned_mass_shooting/","promo_specified",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/8gtveq/the_suspect_in_the_recent_planned_mass_shooting/",59685,False,False,2048,"best"

"I always like seeing folks' DEXA results so thought I'd share mine (and hopefully get some input on what I should do next.) 

**Some background**: I've been lifting for 3 years and have put on about 10 lbs over the past year after I stopped tracking my food. 120 lbs used to be the weight at which I'd start looking kind of chubby and squishy, but lifting has really changed my body, so I wanted to see if this might be muscle gains before I started freaking out.

**Scan results:** [Here are my pics and DEXA printout](https://imgur.com/a/pQNx6Yj) -- NSFW for a partial butt! 


I was hoping for a BF% in the low 20s and steeling myself to get 30+, so this is... okay? I guess? I'm disappointed by my lower body composition (thought I'd have more muscle there) and by my bone mass, which is apparently just barely at a healthy level, possibly because I had an ED all through my 20s and messed myself up. Time to start mainlining calcium!


**Questions:** I'd been planning to start a cut now that the weather  is warm, but with so little muscle on my lower body and so little fat on my torso I'm wondering if I should up my protein, eat at maintenance, and do a lot of volume training on my legs to try and recomp.

"So, I bought a drone in real life.

Today it¬¥s a windy day in my city, but not really bad, and I decide to fly a while in this nice spot near the sea. I have only flyed it for a week and I'm still looking for every opportunity in my time table to do a quick session.

Everything is OK until the remote yells something like STRONG WIND ALERT YOU ARE GONNA DIE, so I turn the drone to me and begin to try to descend but... it flies away, fast, backwards, just going oposite to me. Batt is at 50%. I maintain pressed the stick but it keeps going away until I'm barely able to see it.

Ok, I stop and try to relax, but the >1000‚Ç¨ drone is 1k away over the sea and so high, so maybe better if I first go a little down. I touch the stick and it begins to go up, and up! Batt is at 30% and my drone is doing to drown because it¬¥s doing the oposite that I tell, or maybe the wind is so strong and its being carried away.

"Thought I would share a little story of how it went down when I said goodbye to my ex's father. Something that really touched me.

First of all, some context. I am 22 and she broke up with me after a 4.5 year relationship. We grew apart, it wasn't sour. It's been 4 months now and I am the happiest I've ever been in my life.

Now, about her dad. He was the type of man that would basically kill you if you were to treat his daughter wrong. A confident, tough man but with the kindest of hearts. From day one he treated me as his own son. He would do anything for me. He saw me as family and I will always cherish the connection we shared.

The day she told me that it's time to move on went like this:

I was an absolute mess. I couldn't hold it together. I didn't want to see her parents like this but I forced myself to say goodbye to them out of respect. I was already at my ex's house when she delivered the news. Usually I can hold back tears in any situation - but not this one.

I went up to her father, took his hand in mine and told him with tears down my face, ""Thank you for everything you've done for me. Goodbye mate."" I wanted to say more, but at that stage there was no way I was holding it together much more than that. I saw his eyes begin to redden and go glossy. I had to go before things got out of hand.

I would have never expected to see him cry, but seeing him like that meant the world to me at the time and shows me that I must have really meant something to him. 

I'd love to catch up with him over a beer one day.

"Hi All,

This is my first post on Reddit.

Sorry for my bad English. 

And I am sorry if my story is such a clich√©.

I am 40. I'm French. 

I had lived with my girlfriend for 5 years before this story began.

Unfortunately, even though I loved my girlfriend, I flirted with other women. I just couldn't help it.

What was I looking for? I don't know. A thrill.

Probably I have an insecure, narcissistic personality.

My girlfriend realized I was flirting and she began having difficulties having sex with me. 

She said I must correct this trait of mine before she could give herselft to me again.

I loved this girlfriend \(let us say ""the ex""\) very much. We did everything together and had lots of fun.

I saw a therapist to try and understand WHY I flirted.

But I did not feel therapist really understood what was going on with me, so I switched from therapist to therapist.

And I missed careless, ""wild"" sex.

Until one day a new girl comes around in the gym I frequented.

We had so much in common. 

I cheated on my ex with this girl \(let us say ""the new""\). 

The sex was amazing. She is a great person. 

The new girl wanted me to leave the ex.

And I did it. I left the ""ex"".

I had no place to go, so I immediately went to live with the ""new"".

The ""ex"" was heartbroken.

And, you know what? So was I. After a couple of weeks, although I liked the ""new"" so much, I began to think I had been a shit to leave the ""ex"" out of the blue.

I started crying like every night for what I had done.

The ""new"" girl began to feel something was wrong and started being upset with me for not being participative.

Until I could not take it anymore.

Three months after living with the ""new"", I am now living in a hotel as I think I need to understand myself.

Except I can't.

I feel everything I do is wrong.

I miss the ""ex"". I miss the ""new"". EQUALLY.

I don't know what to do.",False,0,False,"M40, Torn between ex and new girlfriend, and so unhappy","r/relationship_advice",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gxtok",False,"dark","public",41,"self.relationship_advice","",False,False,False,41,"self",False,True,"text",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"richtext",False,"t5_2r0cn","8gxtok",0,22,True,"/r/relationship_advice/comments/8gxtok/m40_torn_between_ex_and_new_girlfriend_and_so/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8gxtok/m40_torn_between_ex_and_new_girlfriend_and_so/",533529,False,False,2048,"best"

"###**Context: At the time I attended a night school to get a degree in architecture and more than often we would work in AutoCAD or Sketchup and do some building, just your regular apartments and stuff.**

I helped some classmates during this time teaching them how to use the PC because I was fast at finishing my projects and more than often I would do them at home and bring them already done in class (the teacher was ok with it, less work for him I suppose), I helped those who really put time into learning AutoCAD and were struggling (free of charge of course)

But there were these kids, no younger than me, that asked for help and by help they meant ""Give us your projects so we can put our names on them""

One day they ask me if I could give them the 4 projects we did until then (that we did in the span of 2 months to be clear they had time), I kindly said that it was my work and they took time and effort, but if they pay for them I could ""share"" for ‚Ç¨10 a piece, they got angry and demanded that I gave them the projects for free because they'll fail that class  if they didn't had the projects by the end of the week and that I've been helping other classmates, but wouldn't help them because I was an asshole, I simply ignored them.

When the class began they proceeded to laugh and to shittalk about me, but loud enough for me to hear them, the following days they kept asking me on social media if I could share my projects just to ""*compare them with theirs*"" needless to say that I didn't and they got bad grades.

This story however has a happy ending.

Some weeks later the teacher introduces me to this old lady from another class that was having trouble using AutoCAD and that she would pay me 12‚Ç¨ per hour to teach her, I could not contain the smirk on my face as this happened in front of these students that got a bad grades for no doing their projects.

"6 years ago, I completed an unique study of autumn squashes for my GCSE Art exams. This was chosen by the exam board as an example of a full mark project. When I graduated two years later, i asked for all my work back, including this project. However, this was not returned. 

Last year, I visited my school for a reunion. Went to the art display. Surprised to see multiple painting ‚Äòinspired‚Äô (copying) my original project. Again, I emailed the school for the paintings to be returned. They never replied. 

I have two questions: 

1) Are the school allowed to keep my work? 
2) Many other pupils had copied my painting in examined works. Is this legal? 
3) Regarding 1) and 2), can I claim remuneration as my work was used as a teaching template?

**Faked Magic cards and board games are a million dollar business**


No matter whether It‚Äôs Magic or Catan: the business with faked card- and board games has drastically increased ‚Äì and the items are sometimes sold on popular online platforms such as eBay and Amazon. And the faked games are hardly different from the originals. Especially disillusioning for customers who assumed they had purchased a rarity or a valuable collector‚Äôs item.


In Asia, it‚Äôs no longer just Luis-Vuitton bags and iPhones that are being faked, but also card- and board games. The first signs of this trend that are currently showing themselves on the German market are however just a test run, says Carol Rapp. She‚Äôs the German market boss of Asmodee, one of the largest board game companies in the world. She‚Äôs monitoring how suppliers from Asia are probing the German market with their cheap imitations.
The alleged counterfeiters offer games at low prices ‚Äì which are then never delivered. They want to develop a feel for how many people would buy at which price. The same thing happened on the English-speaking market two years ago. Shortly after the market was flooded with counterfeits. 


Responsible for this development is the success of card- and board games. Their popularity is on the verge of pushing them into the mass market ‚Äì not only in Germany but worldwide. In 2016 the revenue with collectible items in the USA and Canada grew by 20%, according to the business journal ICv2 ‚Äî with Magic: the Gathering as the uncontested frontrunner at the top. And even the good old board game is turning into a top seller: analysts predict the industry to grow by 9% in the next five years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just in to game, so the counterfeiters have a potential market‚Äù says Rapp.


This particularly affects the classics and bestsellers: Catan (formerly ‚ÄúThe Settlers of Catan‚Äù), Seven Wonders, Ticket to Ride, Pandemic and Werwolves. All games with little to no text on the actual playing materials. They only require exchanging their respective manuals in order to export them to a variety of countries. This next step seems to be imminent now: ‚ÄúEven to us, who know everything about the products, it is sometimes hard to tell the fake from the original‚Äù, says Rapp. With an extraordinary good fake of Ticket to Ride the only real difference was the smaller size of the plastic trains.


People who aren‚Äôt fans of board games thus won‚Äôt immediately recognize a fake; at best that the game is deteriorating more quickly because of the cheaper materials used to produce it. And the customers are voicing their concerns on the internet: last July Amazon observed an increase in 1-star-ratings of board games, indicating that the customers had bought a faked item.


In reaction to this trend, Asmodee‚Äôs North American boss Christian T. Petersen stated in an interview with ICv2 that the fakes had been mixed up with original games at Amazon‚Äôs warehouse. In order to do that, the counterfeiters abused one of Amazon‚Äôs systems called Fullfill. This system allows merchants to store their products directly with Amazon to ensure quicker delivery. Amazon didn‚Äôt want to confirm in writing or via phone whether this had actually happened.


But Amazon seems to have a counterfeiting problem not only with board games. In the United States CEOs from all kinds of industries are currently complaining. Among them the shoe manufacturer Birkenstock and the smartphone case producer Otter Products. Daimler is even suing Amazon right now, because according to the automobile company Amazon isn‚Äôt doing enough to stop the sale of faked tires. Of course Amazon isn‚Äôt the only platform possibly used to distribute fakes ‚Äì but they are the most prominent one. The Czech board game publisher Czech Games Edition‚Äôs website warns of fakes its top-selling board game Codenames, which are distributed via eBay and the Chinese shopping platform Alibaba.


But even though board game fakes still haven‚Äôt arrived in German online shops, it isn‚Äôt difficult to buy them. With just a couple of mouse clicks we were able to purchase a counterfeited copy of the classic board game Pandemic ‚Äì for 23 Euro including shipping from Shanghai, instead of the regular price of almost 40 Euro. The contents are disappointing: thin cards, cheaply processed pieces made from wood ‚Äì the originals are plastic. Asmodee-boss Rapp says an experience like that especially deterrents customers who only rarely buy board games. Because they think the poor quality was normal.


Asmodee estimates just their North American loss in revenue because of counterfeits to range between four and eight million Euro. With especially popular games over 70% of sold games in America are said to have been fakes. An expansion of these fakes to the European market seems to be obvious. 


For the customers those fakes are annoying, but at least they‚Äôre usually getting a complete und functional game. The biggest loss in value for the customers only sets in when board- and card games turn into valuable rarities ‚Äì and become only available on the secondary market anymore. Like with Magic: the Gathering, the most successful trading card game in the world. Even here the Asian counterfeits have increased.


When Magic-trader Mitja Held buys thousands of cards at a big event, he‚Äôll sometimes have a couple of fakes among them. For about every 10,000 cards that move through the hands of the 27-year old, there‚Äôs usually one faked card: ‚ÄúIn contrast to prior years, this trend has increased‚Äù, says Held. He‚Äôs the chief buying agent for JK Entertainment, one of Germany‚Äôs largest trading card merchants for Magic cards. A rare or powerful piece of cardboard can quickly rise to values of over 50 Euros. And anyone who wants to compete at the highest levels can‚Äôt do without it. Therefor it‚Äôs even more annoying for customers if instead of the real rarity they receive a worthless piece of cardboard.


A couple of years ago, counterfeited cards were still said to be done amateurish and were easy to recognize, says Held. But over time the copies got better and even he has problems when time is of essence ‚Äì perhaps because the queue in front of his both keeps getting longer. ‚ÄúI these cases I can‚Äôt always check every 10-Euro card‚Äù, he says.
Among the most faked cards are those in the middle price segment: for example Scalding Tarn, for which tournament players and collectors easily pay about 40 Euros for. Everyone who wants to be competitive needs four of those. And the magical tarn isn‚Äôt even one of those powerful cards from the early days of Magic (1993) which are routinely sold for hundreds, sometimes thousands of Euros. Scalding Tarn was printed in 2009.


In Asia, a faked Scalding Tarn goes for about 2 Euro. Anyone in the know of the right keywords can find those offers on usually foreign online shops. But even on European platforms the first offers of this kind have started popping up, says Held: ‚ÄúThis might turn into a problem.‚Äù


During an online chat with one of the Asian sellers of counterfeited Magic cards, he or she says they sold 30 to 50 sets per month. Every one of these sets contains ten cards, that Held‚Äôs shop lists for a total price of 300 Euro. But things are getting tougher, says the counterfeiter: ‚ÄúWizards has my offers deleted. Potential customers care about my ratings, which are deleted as well.‚Äù So the producers of Magic know about counterfeiting business and are trying to take action against it: Elaine Chase, responsible for strategy and marketing at Wizards, says they were working with law enforcement agencies around the world: ‚ÄúWizard is actively working towards protecting the Magic community from fakes.‚Äù


The issue has long arrived to Magic tournaments as well: ‚ÄúWe regularly check the players‚Äô cards‚Äù, says judge Daniel Maier, primarily responsible for the Bavarian tournament scene. Previously he just made sure the players were following the deck construction rules, these days Maier sometimes also has to bust out the magnifying glass and check the authenticity of the cards. Counterfeits are then destroyed the players removed from the tournament. But because the illegal cards are usually unrecognizable on first glance ‚Äì especially in the protective sleeves mandatory at tournaments ‚Äì those cases are rather rare: ‚ÄúAt big tournaments we can only check a small numbers of players‚Äù, says Maier. He still notes: The number of faked cards has increased.


Because of the increase in fakes there‚Äôs now even seminars and talks for judges, concerning this issue. At such events fake-expert and judge Max Tiedemann explains how to quickly spot these cards: ‚ÄúBy now there‚Äôs counterfeits which are able to pass certain tests‚Äù, he says. It is often not enough anymore to weigh them or check the paper quality; one has to check the printing pattern with a jeweler‚Äôs magnifying glass. And while newer cards now sport a small hologram on the bottom, similar to a bank note and relatively unforgeable, older and especially valuable cards lack this mechanism.


So while with board games it is primarily about copying successful games with as cheap as possible materials, the trend with Magic cards goes into the opposite direction: they got to be better and better. Until they become undistinguishable from the original. The biggest current obstacle to that are the paper and the printer color. The faked cards we bought online for testing also had small irregularities. They felt too smooth and in good light, the printing on the back looked coarse and washed-out. But it is probably just a matter of time until the differences vanish.


‚ÄúWhether the issue with fakes becomes worse depends on whether Magic cards remain affordable‚Äù, says Held. He estimates that if the aforementioned 40 Euro card isn‚Äôt reprinted in den next years, it will rise to 100 Euro. Just like with board games, high prices and popularity make cards appeal to forgers. If Wizards of the Coast was to regularly reprint those cards, the problem with counterfeits would probably vanish. Forging a card that costs 5 Euro isn‚Äôt feasible. However this would also hurt the business model of the card game, because collecting and owning rare cards is an important reason for players to constantly buy new products.


How benefits from the many fakes right now? Merchants like Held, because they can use their expertise to guarantee their customers don‚Äôt have to afraid of fakes. Eventually the problem might solve itself just on its own, says Held: ‚ÄúOnce fakes can‚Äôt be distinguished from genuine cards. At that point they de-facto become Magic cards.‚Äù We‚Äôre still very far from that point, but card prices keep increasing every year.

"My kid turned 9 in the last week. I prophesied‚Ñ¢ to my wife that now that he wasn't considered a child baptism, but a convert baptism, that the missionaries would start hunting for him, like unto the nazgul searching for the ring, from middleearth, of old. 

Of course they show up today, make small talk, and ask if my kids are baptized. I can't be too mad. I did it on my mission too. Hoping that someone forgot to baptize a kid so I could pick up some easy points. 

They asked me why he wasn't baptized. I said I don't have any supernatural beliefs. Awkward silence.

"This fuckup happened in January but the consequences are very much happening today. If you're confused about the title then you're probably not British. A 'stag do'  is what we call a bachelor party, or pre-wedding party weekend of drinking with just the boys. So anyway, this one was planned and booked back in January. Our friend is getting married in the summer, and we wanted to give him a good send off so we planned a weekend away on the continent, just the lads, plenty of beer, no nonsense. Berlin was chosen as the venue, we've been to Germany before and love the culture (beer), the entertainment (beer) and the nightlife (beer). The best man (groom's best friend) found an agent that would sort everything out. He emailed us a quote that included flights, transfers, accommodation and even a few activities while we're there (beer). I took one look at it and decided I could get a better price booking it all myself. So I asked for the flight details and went online to ruin the trip for myself. And that's what I did. Instead of booking the flight which everyone else was on, I booked one with an 8 hour stop over in Brussels. I only realised the fuck up yesterday morning when I proudly announced on the group chat that I had successfully checked in online and they should all do the same because I definitely know what I'm doing and have my shit together. It was quickly pointed out to me that I'm the only one that will be spending today in Belgium. This all adds to the shame.  So I'm now on the train from Brussels airport to the central station to try and amuse myself on my own for 8 hours while 12 of my friends are in Berlin getting pissed. I'm heading for the central square so if you want a beer with me, send a PM.  I'll buy the first round. TL/DR I tried to get a cheaper flight than my friends for a weekend away in Germany, ended up stuck in Belgium for most of Friday.

"### [This post is a collaboration with /u/never_mind_me_kay]    

Hi all! ¬†¬†

Since we're all Haikyuu!! enthusiasts gathered here, /u/never_mind_me_kay and I thought it'd be a fun and rewarding exercise to compile a list of trivia - fun, informative, some relatively obscure, and some relatively commonplace facts - pertaining to everything Haikyuu!! and share it with the community. This is not a fully-comprehensive, be-all and end-all trivia list. However, we did strive to recall, look up and add as many of the lesser-known stuffs as possible. For convenience, we decided to post this in installments. So, this is the first part of a two-part post.   

We hope you guys have an enjoyable read!  

******   

* ‚ÄúHaikyuu‚Äù is **the official Japanese term for volleyball** (likewise, soccer is ""shokyuu"" and basketball is ""rokyuu""). Although, in Japan, the sport is colloquially referred to by the English word ""volleyball"", Furudate chose the Japanese word ""haikyuu"" as the title for the series because to name a volleyball manga as ""Volleyball"" would sound too obvious and strange. ¬†

* August 19th is **official Haikyuu!! Day** in Japan. Why, you ask? It's because ""Haikyuu"" can be rewritten as 819 (ha = hachi = 8; i = ichi = 1; kyuu = 9). ¬†¬†

* In [a 2014 interview](http://rainofashe.tumblr.com/post/141608254357/monthly-volleyball-2014-march-issue-haikyuu), Furudate was asked what he intended to convey through Haikyuu!!, and his response was this: ‚ÄúThe fact that volleyball is fun and cool! I hope that Haikyuu!! can become a gateway for people to become truly interested in and pick up volleyball. I want it to be a story which both people who play and do not play volleyball can enjoy, and I‚Äôll work hard on that.‚Äù And looks like Furudate achieved his goal, considering the fact that **the number of high school students enrolling in (male) volleyball clubs increased rapidly since Haikyuu!! began its serialisation**. This was covered in [an NHK documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9E_jkpGmpc). There's also a clip of [**Furudate drawing Hinata**](https://youtu.be/K-FPJvOxEw8) from the same documentary series. ¬†¬†

* The mascot that's seen at Nationals and appears in many other instances (such as on kid!Oikawa's thundersticks in a flashback scene, on a shirt Hinata wears at the Summer Training Camp, and on kid!Ushijima's shirt in a flashback scene) is called **[Vabo-chan](http://i.imgur.com/SsQdlFa.jpg), Japan's official volleyball mascot**. Vabo is a shortened and cutesy name for volleyball. When Japan first started hosting the FIVB Men's World Cup in 1977, they originally had two mascots - a red volleyball named Vabo-chan and a white volleyball named Nana-chan. The colours red and white were chosen to represent the Japanese flag. Since Nana-chan was named on the basis of the year 1977 (7 is nana in Japanese), the name eventually lost its validity, leaving only Vabo-chan. He was then given a variety of other colours. ¬†¬†

* **Furudate's favourite characters are Hinata, Tanaka, Aone and Bokuto**. In his words, ‚ÄúI like characters who don‚Äôt think about the consequences before acting. I‚Äôm someone who tends to overthink the consequences, so I really admire characters like them.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬†

* Kageyama was **the very first Haikyuu!! character created**. Before Haikyuu!! as we know it today came to be, there were two prototype one-shot chapters that were published in Weekly Shounen Jump in early 2011. In [the first prototype chapter](http://september.strawberrywine.org/archives/8995/), Kageyama was the main character whose personality was similar to that of his middle-school counterpart in the serialised canon; Hinata was disinterested in volleyball and was only dragged into it by Kageyama who recognised his potential; and Tanaka was a bully. 

* **In [the second prototype chapter](https://mangapark.me/manga/haikyu/s1/c000/3), Tsukishima was a second-year**, which was changed in the serialised version where he's a first-year. In [an extra sketch](https://i.imgur.com/hWU5V7I.png), Furudate commented, ""Tsukki and Tanaka being in the same year would spell chaos!"". ¬†


* **Sendai, the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture, serves as the main backdrop** for much of the pre-Nationals arc of the story. A number of explicit and subtle references to real-life locations, historical figures, etc. associated with present-day Sendai, have been incorporated into the series. Sendai itself, in turn, has various tributes to Haikyuu!! spread all throughout the city.   

  * **Sendai City Gymnasium** (now known as Kamei Arena Sendai, after its renovation and renaming) is **the venue for the Miyagi Prefecture Representative Playoffs, both in real life and Haikyuu!!**. It hosts both domestic and international tournaments, not just of volleyball but also other sports. [Here](http://syncopatedid.tumblr.com/post/118610453008/sendaigym)'s a cool Tumblr post with photos drawing parallels of some of the in-series spots to their real-life counterparts.   

  * **""Aoba Jousai"" (ÈùíËëâÂüéË•ø) literally means ""west of Aoba Castle"", which is also known as Sendai Castle** (a castle of historical significance that once stood in present-day Sendai and was home to the powerful Date clan; it was destroyed during WWII and today only some of its ruins remain). This ties in with [Oikawa‚Äôs depiction as a king and his teammates as knights](http://i.imgur.com/EKWc9wY.jpg) and the fact that their official banner reads [""Rule the Court""](http://i.imgur.com/uMyJG9q.jpg). At the same time, **the ""aoba"" (ÈùíËëâ) in Aoba Jousai loosely translates to ""blue leaves""**, meaning fresh leaves or something to that effect. This is why we sometimes see **Seijoh being represented as plants in official merchandise and fanworks**.  

  * **Shiratorizawa is modelled on the Izumi Campus of [Tohoku High School](https://i.imgur.com/MsD8Q86h.jpg)** in Sendai. The school even published [an article](http://www.tohoku.ed.jp/news/details.html?CN=116150) on their website about this in 2014. Like the fictional school for which it served as a model, Tohoku High is an elite school in terms of both academics and sports. 
 
   * **Nekoma started their trip for their practice matches with Karasuno at the JR Sendai Station**. The station is also a hub for Haikyuu!! souvenirs/merchandises. On the topic of merchandise, the Haikyuu!! corner of Animate Sendai is regularly decorated with fanarts drawn by Animate's staff. [Here](https://twitter.com/animatesendai/status/802835145770221568)'re a few featuring **Karasuno and Shiratorizawa promoting Miyagi Prefecture tourism**.   

  * The **statue of Date Masamune** (a notable ruler from the early Edo period and descendant of a long line of powerful feudal lords in the Tohoku region, and who's **the founder of present-day Sendai**) on horseback is an iconic monument located in Sendai. It was featured in the illustration on [a Haikyuu!! clear file](https://78.media.tumblr.com/0b1fedf94cf7895fc568071f6b888bca/tumblr_nlk4wrEKX91sq03u7o3_1280.jpg). Also, the artwork for [the cover page of ch.126](https://i.imgur.com/IPq7stq.png) is a parody featuring Oikawa as Date Masamune and Kindaichi as a horse!    

  * Sendai is known as ""City of Trees"" for its great number of trees and lush greenery. The area that's particularly well-known for this is [**Johzenji Avenue**](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/377/31921328896_a0b7d34be9_c.jpg), which, as you must have already guessed, is **the namesake for Johzenji High**.   

  * **Kyoutani's current concern** - ""Lawson‚Äôs new Karaage Kun is hard to throw away"" - is a reference to the karaage (deep fried chicken) that comes in fancy packaging and is sold by [Lawson, a convenience store in Sendai](https://twitter.com/lawsonofficiale/status/979614219636064256).   

  * The underpass between JR Sendai Station and Sendai Subway has been adorned with displays of (warning: linked Twitter post includes photos of characters that appear in the manga, post-S3 events) [Haikyuu!! characters' profiles](https://twitter.com/pkpkp_4/status/983661805745520640) for **promotion of the Haikyuu!! Art Exhibition**, which was held from 15th to 29th April 2018 at Kamei Arena Sendai (formerly Sendai City Gymnasium). ¬†¬†

* Furudate was born in **Iwate Prefecture** and lived there until high school graduation, after which he moved to Miyagi. Haikyuu!! pays homage to a number of real-life locations in Iwate, as well.   

  * The town of Karasuno, although is said to be located in Miyagi Prefecture in-series, is actually **inspired by the town of Karumai**, which is located in Iwate Prefecture and is Furudate's hometown. It's a small, obscure town that doesn't attract many tourists but, for any Haikyuu!! fan, it's worth taking a trip to. Departmental stores, restaurants, stationery shops, shopping districts - pretty much every place pays homage to the series that took the town as a model for the backdrop where the story of the protagonists unfolds. [Karumai Shokudo](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/264/32338643381_83769b2ee7_c.jpg), a restaurant thoroughly adorned with Haikyuu!! goods, also has special Haikyuu!! Ramen.   

  * Remember **the opening scene where a young Hinata watches the Little Giant on the TV of an electronics store** and becomes inspired to pick up volleyball? The setting for this scene has its real-life counterpart in [Karumai‚Äôs main shopping street](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/274/31617023104_544b0325c4_c.jpg). Likewise, [Sakanoshita Shop](https://onesamurai.jp/pilgrimage/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/05/haikyu_002-1024x768.jpg) is modelled on an actual shop located at the crossroads of a slope. The inspiration for Shimada Mart is [Takesawa Store](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/362/31648287173_993d361119_c.jpg). And the model for Shinzen High, located in Saitama Prefecture in-series, is [Karumai College](https://onesamurai.jp/pilgrimage/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/05/haikyu_005-1024x768.jpg).   

  * Does [this](http://livedoor.sp.blogimg.jp/jin115/imgs/b/f/bf2a8edf.jpg) seem familiar? It's the doorway leading to the gymnasium of **[Karumai High School](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/768/31616982474_8a478ed97a_c.jpg) - a public school which is the inspiration for Karasuno and is Furudate's alma mater**. The school takes pride in this fact and has various artworks of Haikyuu!! decorating the campus. And, like its fictional counterpart, the school is also located on the top of a hill. ¬†  

  * Behold **[Furudate Seimen](http://hattouya.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/furudate01.jpg) - a noodle shop in Karumai, owned and run by none other than Furudate‚Äôs family**! The shop is [adorned with Haikyuu!! goods and Furudate‚Äôs artworks](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/430/32081931930_5c854e65e9_c.jpg). [Here](http://hattouya.com)'s the shop‚Äôs official website. ¬†  

  * All the Seijoh characters are named after various **hot springs situated in Iwate**. For instances, Matsukawa is named after Matsukawa Onsen and Hanamaki is named after Hanamaki Onsen, and so on (onsen means hot spring or resort with a hot spring).   

  * **Iwaizumi is named after the hot springs town of Iwaizumi, in Iwate**. Tributes to Seijoh's ace (and Seijoh as a whole) can be found throughout the town. For instance, the roadside station has a Haikyuu!! corner, with life-size tapestries of Iwaizumi and Oikawa, to welcome visitors. Illustrations by Furudate are also hung there. One was drawn by Furudate as [a gesture of moral support](https://honyakukanomangen.tumblr.com/post/149978644098/from-furudate-sensei-and-haikyuu-staff-our) for the residents when the town was hit by a typhoon in 2016, and another was drawn as [a gift to the town](https://honyakukanomangen.tumblr.com/post/159484007338/after-typhoon-lionrock-that-hit-iwaizumi-iwate) for the commemoration of the reopening of the roadside station after it was closed for rebuilding and renovation in the aftermath of the typhoon.  

* All the Datekou characters are named after **hot springs in Miyagi Prefecture**. All the Shiratorizawa characters (with the exception of Ushijima and Tendou) are named after **hot springs in Yamagata Prefecture**. All the [manga spoiler](#s ""Inarizaki characters, with the exception of the Miya twins, are named after various fox breeds""). And all the Fukurodani characters are named after **various owl breeds**. ¬†  

* Ushijima's nickname **Ushiwaka was the childhood name of a legendary Japanese warrior**, Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Also, remember Hinata thinking of Reon as Benkei? Benkei was the right hand man of Yoshitsune. So, the names Ushiwaka and Benkei usually go together in people's minds (as a side note, there's a short animation film on this legendary duo - [*Benkei tai Ushiwaka*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12561/Benkei_tai_Ushiwaka)). ¬†¬†

* Tendou is named after **Tendou City in Yamagata Prefecture**. The city is Japan‚Äôs largest producer of shogi (Japanese chess) pieces. Shogi pieces are assigned roles similar to those of chess pieces and each starting player has 20 five-sided pieces. Interestingly, Tendou‚Äôs birthday is May 20 and his jersey number is also 5. This may be intentional or coincidental. Also, in Japanese folklore, **Satori is a youkai (spirit) that can read the minds of humans**. Tendou‚Äôs first name is perhaps based off this fact, considering the fact that he's given the nickname Guess Monster and his blocking-style seems as if he has an ability to look into people's minds(?).

* **‚ÄúBokuto‚Äù (Êú®ÂàÄ) literally means horned owl**. It's also the name of a Japanese wooden sword used for training. ‚Äúboku‚Äù (Êú®) means wood and ‚Äúto‚Äù (ÂàÄ) is a shortened form of ‚Äúnihonto‚Äù (Êó•Êú¨ÂàÄ), meaning Japanese sword. ¬†¬†

* Yamaguchi‚Äôs first name Tadashi means ""loyalty"" or ""devotion"". **The kanji for Tadashi (Âø†) can also be read as Hachiko, which is the name of a famous Japanese dog** that's known for its remarkable loyalty to its deceased owner. Yamaguchi and Hachiko also share the same birthday (November 10). ¬†

* [manga spoiler](#s ""Atsumu (‰æë)"") means ""to assist"" and [manga spoiler](#s ""Osamu (Ê≤ª)"") means ""to rule/govern"". While at first that might sound ironical, given [manga spoiler](#s ""the Twins' personalities""), we may look at it another way - [manga spoiler](#s ""Atsumu is a setter. Osamu is a spiker."") And the one thing we've been told about the setter and the spiker's roles time and again is that in an attack, the spiker has the leadership and the setter's job is to ""assist"" the spiker by giving the latter the best possible toss and enabling him to hit it to the best of his ability. Also, [potential manga spoiler](#s ""'Atsui' and 'Samui' mean 'hot' and 'cold' respectively""), which ties in with [manga spoiler](#s ""Atsumu's hot-blooded personality as compared to Osamu's more cool and laid-back disposition""). 

* Although [manga spoiler](#s ""Inarizaki"") is from Hyougo Prefecture, Furudate stated in vol.31 that [this location](https://78.media.tumblr.com/4ca689d42bc8379e0cc199e3120b9d85/tumblr_p7ih8aXAF51uopq2lo6_400.jpg) which appears in [manga spoiler](#s ""Kita's backstory in ch.274"") is actually in Oita Prefecture. Also, going by [this panel](http://i.imgur.com/ACsdVNA.jpg), [manga spoiler](#s ""Inarizaki"") apparently hails from the city of Amagasaki in Hyougo Prefecture (courtesy of [this Twitter post](https://twitter.com/793TL/status/952455180120817665)). On a related note, coincidentally, Hyougo Prefecture's representative at the real-life Spring High tournament has been Amagasaki High for several years; they‚Äôve represented Hyougo a total of 30 times thus far. ¬†¬†

* The **birthdays** of some of the characters have interesting significances ([here](http://icechain.tumblr.com/post/86946731768/haikyuu-birthday-meaning)'s an extended list of characters and the significance behind their respective birthdays).   

  * Hinata's birthday (21 June) and Kageyama‚Äôs birthday (22 December) are the summer solstice and the winter solstice respectively.   

  * Nishinoya's birthday (October 10) and Asahi‚Äôs birthday (January 1) are opposites (10/10 ‚áî 01/01).   

  * Oikawa shares his birthday (July 20) with Alexander the Great, while Iwaizumi's birthday (June 10) is Alexander's death date.   

  * Ushijima's birthday (August 13) is International Lefthanders' Day.   

  * Yaku's birthday (August 8) is World Cat Day and Taketora's birthday (February 22) is Japan‚Äôs Cat Day. ¬†¬†

* Kageyama is the youngest first-year on Karasuno and therefore **the youngest member on the team**, while Hinata is the oldest among the Karasuno first-years. And Tanaka who, although technically is a second-year, is actually about the same age as Hinata. ¬†

* The initials of Tobio (È£õÈõÑ) and Shouyou (ÁøîÈôΩ) are **an anagram (È£õÁøî)**. È£õÁøî means **‚Äúflying‚Äù**. ¬†

* Furudate used the famous 19th century painting **[‚ÄúLiberty Leading the People‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/t7mEskc.jpg) by Eug√®ne Delacroix** as a reference for [the cover page of ch.94](http://i.imgur.com/WaFDHMY.jpg). ¬†¬†

* There‚Äôs a [Haikyuu!! reference](https://i.redd.it/jint0u9xfsax.jpg) in ***Gintama***'**s Jump Festa 2015 Special Episode**, where Kagura comments that *Gintama* is far below Haikyuu!! in terms of animation quality. In the 2017 anime ***Tsuki ga Kirei***, Haikyuu!! is referenced twice. There's one scene where we can see [a poster](https://i.imgur.com/3Xrl89Gl.png) featuring a few Haikyuu!! characters in the background. And in another scene (the context is a school sports meet), the characters shout [chants](https://i.imgur.com/YzrVLU4.jpg) that are reminiscent of the Datekou and Seijoh chants. Haikyuu!! is also [referenced](http://i.imgur.com/bItSz8U.jpg) in the first episode of ***Himouto! Umaru-chan***, where the cover of Weekly Shounen Jump is shown to be featuring Haikyuu!! at the corner. The title is however changed to ‚ÄúHoikyuu!!"". In celebration of **the 20th anniversary of** ***One Piece*** in 2017, all Weekly Shounen Jump titles paid tribute to the series in the magazine's 33rd issue of that year. In Haikyuu!!, [Hinata could be spotted wearing a straw hat](http://i.imgur.com/Qd93Lv8.jpg) in a panel of ch.262. It's also worth mentioning that Furudate has stated One Piece‚Äôs author Oda Eiichiro (along with Miyazaki Hayao, the co-founder of Studio Ghibli) as a source of inspiration. 

* Furudate stated that he had to put in a lot of effort to arrive at **Hinata‚Äôs final design**. Tsukishima's glasses and Oikawa's hair are things he finds difficult to draw. He also claimed that **initially he used to struggle with drawing characters with good looks** like Oikawa and Kiyoko. ¬†¬†¬†

* **Haikyuu!!'s OST is co-composed by Hayashi Yuuki and Tachibana Asami**. Hayashi has composed most of the hype and action-oriented ""battle"" tracks that play during intense moments of the matches, while Tachibana has composed the comparatively mellower tracks such as character themes and the ones that play during ""slice of life-esque"" moments. ¬†

* From the very beginning, **Tsukishima was the character Furudate most wanted to draw making a victorious fist pump**, and this finally came to fruition in ch.163 where Tsukishima blocks Ushijima's spike. In the manga, however, Tsukishima doesn't scream in celebration after the block. It's a nice addition by the anime's scriptwriter(s)/director(s). ¬†¬†

* In the author note in vol.29, Furudate stated that way before Haikyuu!! was even conceived, he went to watch the Spring High, and there the cheer squad of Souma High, comprising of taiko drummers, caught his attention and he decided then that **if he were to ever create a manga about volleyball, he'd have the supporters of the protagonist team play taiko drums**. This idea finally came to fruition years later, with [manga spoiler](#s ""Saeko and her fellow taiko drummers' debut as Karasuno's cheer squad at the Inarizaki match""). ¬†¬†

* Light Novel VII gives an explanation of how **glasses!Oikawa** came to be. According to [Chapter 5](http://bungoustraighthome.tumblr.com/post/152628430266/hq-light-novel-vii-how-glasses-oikawa-came-to) of the LN - before the Karasuno vs. Shiratorizawa match, Oikawa visits a store where he muses to himself about his last official match of his high school career, when suddenly a group of girls chatting among themselves about Halloween, Christmas and a bunch of other things catches his attention, and he eavesdrops on their conversation. Instinctively, he turns around and responds to the girls aloud (seriously, this boy). Upon realising the awkward situation he has inadvertently gotten himself into, he ends up buying a pair of glasses in a bid to act smooth and save face (pffft). It should be noted, however, that the light novels aren't written by Furudate and are ""supplementary material"" at best. They walk the line between canon and fanon and must therefore be taken with a grain of salt. ¬†¬†

* **Kenma doesn‚Äôt cut his hair because if his field of vision is too wide, it makes him anxious**. In the extra chapter [""Story of the Pudding Head""](http://haikyuu819.tumblr.com/post/128409063530/tsukishimacest-haikyuu-volume-4-bonus) in vol.04, Taketora suggests Kenma to change his hairstyle because it makes him stand out. Taketora meant to suggest him to cut his hair shorter, but Kenma misinterprets it and dyes his hair instead. ¬†¬†

* **Kuroo‚Äôs unusual hairstyle is just his natural bed-head**. When he sleeps, he has a habit of pressing the sides of his face with pillows. His current concern is that he can‚Äôt get rid of this hairdo. For it, he's also called [manga spoiler](#s ""Rooster Head"" by Daishou""). ¬†¬†

* The notebook that Kiyoko is often seen carrying and writing in is based off **[Campus](http://i.imgur.com/qoJxjGT.jpg), a Japanese brand of notebooks** manufactured by Kokuyo. In the Haikyuu!!

"So this is a mild rant, but I acknowledge my perspective may be wrong and I am open to other opinions.  
  
I feel resentment towards my SO because I don‚Äôt think he gets how big a deal having sex is to me.  We just started having sex two months ago and we used a condom and withdrawal together, but I still felt very scared about getting pregnant.  While I am old enough to support a child if I needed to, I am terrified of the pain of pregnancy and even terrified of the pain of getting an abortion.  I feel like my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt understand that the risk of getting pregnant stresses me out, even if its small.
  
I started the pill to feel more protected, but it‚Äôs still not easy for me.  I have trouble hiding the pills from my parents and they currently are causing me to have cramps and mood swings for the past few weeks.  It‚Äôs not horrible and hopefully will get better but it sucks.  
  
I‚Äôm not writing for advice on birth control.  I‚Äôm writing this because even though i enjoy sex and was not pressured by my bf to have sex, I wouldn‚Äôt be having sex if it wasn‚Äôt important to my boyfriend.  I am risk averse I would probably just stick to oral/manual forever if i could because I don‚Äôt want to take the risk.  And now with the pill, i feel like it is impacting my current wellbeing, even though it should get better.   
  
So after it all, i feel some resentment towards my bf.  I expect him to do more because I feel like I am making this sacrifice (in a way) for him, and to make him happy.  And while he is understanding when I explain my worry, i feel like i want him to do more for me because i am doing something for him :(.

"Hello once again, Reddit! Today, I wanted to share something with you guys that I feel some of you may be interested in: A huge catalog of decklists that have hit Grandmaster this season of Shadowverse!

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQST2U7rQt3UzKILOxBiHufo2SPf\_4NL98YhrzHnt3M/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQST2U7rQt3UzKILOxBiHufo2SPf_4NL98YhrzHnt3M/edit)

See, in my Discord server, thanks to the hard work and interest of a few dedicated people \(Thanni, Blue, and Kiririin in particular\), they have been collecting and cataloging decklists on Twitter that have hit Grandmaster since the beginning of the season. The result is a now 30 page word document featuring multiple lists of nearly every even remotely competitive archetype in Rotation Shadowverse right now.

Need a good Vengeance Blood list? We got that. Reanimate Shadow? You betcha. Neutral Forest? Ohoho, just you see.

I'm very proud of their continual work as, without bias, I think it's one of the best resources for newer and experienced players I've ever seen compiled in the Western community. And I'd be remiss if such an effort didn't get out to the larger community as a whole. 

In addition, they are now compiling a separate list for month 2 and will \(most likely\) do the same for month 3 when the mini\-expansion comes out with updated lists as well. If you'd like to be part of the discussion and effort to help out, or simply would like a nice Discord server to talk about all things Shadowverse related, here's the link for that as well: [https://discord.gg/HK8qhUn](https://discord.gg/HK8qhUn)

Anyway, hope you enjoy, Reddit! And if you have any GM lists you've used or made that aren't on this catalog yet, feel free to link them in the comments section and I'll pass them along to the Discord.",False,0,False,"Grandmaster Deck List Symposium!","r/Shadowverse",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gxpdm",False,"dark","public",45,"self.Shadowverse","",False,False,False,45,"self",False,"self",True,"richtext",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"richtext",False,"t5_3c35m","8gxpdm",0,4,True,"/r/Shadowverse/comments/8gxpdm/grandmaster_deck_list_symposium/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowverse/comments/8gxpdm/grandmaster_deck_list_symposium/",24294,False,False,2048,"best"

I think we'd all agree that good communication is when the receiver understands the message the sender wants to convey. Achieving good (and of course perfect) communication is trivial for god.

Religious claims of god's communication include holy books, direct communication to specific people (often recorded in holy books), and however the pope finds out that his infallible decrees are infallible.

These methods have resulted in a wealth of different religions, sub-religions, denominations etc.

"Today during a live stream on the official Minecraft Twitch channel a upcoming update for Minecraft on New 3DS was shown what revealed some new stuff coming in the next update.

Game play of the the 3DS version begins around the 8 minute mark, you can find the video [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/257256665) on Twitch

Some things shown off during it were

* The Super Mario Mashup pack from the Wii U and Switch versions is being added
* It will be getting a Performance increase, the base game now runs at 60fps \(mentioned around the 9 minutes and 30 second mark , they also mentioned later that the Super Mario Mash up pack runs at 30fps\)
* A in game store is being added \(mentioned around the 12 minutes and 4 second mark, you can see its icon on the main menu when they start showing gameplay of the New 3DS version \)

They also mentioned that bringing the game to Europe is still being worked on \(said around the 12 minutes and 30 second mark\)

I haven't seen anyone reporting or talking about this anywhere so I decided to make a post with the information they shared since people who play Minecraft on New 3DS will probably be interested in knowing some things coming in the next update.

Edit: fixed a spelling mistake

Edit 2: changed the the time for the video I gave were he starts mentioning that its getting a performance increase from 9 minutes and 37 seconds  to 9 minutes and 30 seconds what is were he starts talking about the better performance where as the other one was when he was done talking about it.",False,0,False,"A upcoming update for Minecraft on New 3DS was shown off today during a livestream","r/3DS",False,6,0,"","all_ads",False,"t3_8gui5a",False,"dark","public",247,"self.3DS","",False,False,False,247,"self",1525437022.0,"self",True,"text",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"richtext",False,"t5_2ruhy","8gui5a",0,40,True,"/r/3DS/comments/8gui5a/a_upcoming_update_for_minecraft_on_new_3ds_was/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/8gui5a/a_upcoming_update_for_minecraft_on_new_3ds_was/",253316,False,False,2048,"best"

"It‚Äôs been quite a while since my last squad review and a lot has changed since. I‚Äôve acquired lots of different players, a couple of new managers and a lot of experience. Players in my squad range from silvers right up to blacks, from hidden gems to well known players. 

This is likely to be a few pages/scrolls of a page long, so by all means don‚Äôt read it all at once. Hopefully I‚Äôve organised it in a way that won‚Äôt make your eyes bleed.

All opinions are my own, so it‚Äôs okay to disagree, there‚Äôs no right or wrong opinion on any player, it comes down to your play style.

Let‚Äôs begin with the players.


*GOALKEEPERS:*


Sergio Romero (78 L27) - One of the best silver goalkeepers , solid stats across the board and does what you expect of him, even at level 15. Cannot wait to see how he performs at higher levels.

Schmeichel (82 L20) - In my opinion he‚Äôs probably the best gold keeper (Ederson and Fahrmann may come close but I haven‚Äôt used them). Brilliant at most things, plays much better than Navas and has reflexes that are not too far off De Gea. An absolute bargain to scout as well, less than 40k. Never lets me down and pulls off some unbelievable saves.

Keylor Navas (85 L30) - A very inconsistent keeper, sometimes he will save the impossible but sometimes he will flap at basic shots. Is easily beaten straight underneath him. Not good enough for a BB keeper.

De Gea (88 L30) - I can echo what most people have said, he is a fantastic keeper, probably the best in the game. Reflexes are second to none (just like in real life). 


*DEFENDERS:*


CBs:

Mina (77 L20) - A pretty decent silver defender to tell the truth, tall, quick, strong and great defensive stats. A mainstay in my silver squad.

Romagnoli (79 L25) - A standard gold centre back, not ridiculously fast or strong but has a decent pass on him and defensive stats. Use him for TP but nothing more.

Stones (79 L25) - Somewhat impressive, a great passer of the ball and good defensive stats. Certainly an improvement on Romagnoli. Have used him at LB on occasion for TP. Good but nothing groundbreaking.

Manolas (81 L20) - One of the first players I ever scouted and a bargain at that (30k a couple months back - Roma + Greece). Even at level 20 he's a very effective centre back - mid to high 80s in all physical and defensive stats. Obviously his main asset is his pace and it shows. Still give him games in my first 11 because I can expect solid mistake free performances from him.

Matip (82 L25) - Tall, quite quick and very strong, the ideal centre back it would seem. Good defensive stats, but doesn‚Äôt feel as good as the other options I have.

Koulibaly (82 L27) - Someone who rarely gets talked about compared to Varane and Manolas, but he is almost as good as them. Physically he is a mountain, 6‚Äô5‚Äù and very high strength with a great ability to win aerial duels. Defensive stats are very solid too, not to mention a ridiculous speed stat for a centre back. Basically the physicality of N'Doye and the speed of Varane rolled into one. Definitely a good option if you are looking to scout.

Umtiti (84 L29) - By no means a back CB but doesn't perform the well as the likes of Varane. Slightly short for my liking (5'11"") but is not unusable. Still a solid option, not too slow and can put in good tackles.

N'Doye (85 L36 at CB) - The man, the myth, the legend. A silver player who performs as good as the other centre backs I've used. Absolute machine, at this level he has 96 balance, 89 jumping and 90 stamina as well as 89 heading, 89 interceptions and even a respectable 77 speed. His best asset is without a doubt his physicality - very rarely beaten in the air and does not let many player past him shoulder to shoulder. Sliding tackles are also the best I've ever used. Some say he struggles against quick strikers and although he won't catch Aubameyang once he's past, he can quite effectively stop him before he's through. Pair with a quick centre back to get the best out of him.

Koscielny (86 L31) - A very solid defensive package, very similar to Varane in a way in that he has superb defensive stats and decent speed. One thing I have noticed is he can put in a crucial block which would otherwise be a goal when you are not controlling him, something Varane does from time to time too. Probably the black ball centre back that goes under the radar but a solid package nonetheless.

Varane (87 L41) - Essentially another Manolas, but slightly better. Defensive stats are some of the best in the game and of course he's lightning fast, capable of containing most forwards but may get outrun by Aubameyang (who doesn't?). Passing range is superb for a centre back. Physical enough to win most duels and score the occasional header. Compliments Manolas very well.

LBs:

Baba (77 L27) - A fantastic silver left back, provides support for your attack but is equally adept in defence. Has pace to burn as well. A good choice if you want a a balanced left back.

Ghoulam (81 L29) - Not a great attacking left back and equally not fantastic in defence. Doesn't have a significant weakness but doesn't stand out in any area. Can't say I'd recommend him.

Alba (86 L35) - Absolutely fantastic, one of the best in his position. Very quick and high stamina means he will get up and down the flank without a problem. Very decent dribbling and passing for a left back - plays like a winger but has decent enough defensive stats to mop up at the back. Slightly weak but that doesn't hold him back.

Alaba (88 L33) - Didn‚Äôt think anyone could trump Alba but Alaba has done just that. Although he doesn‚Äôt have the blistering pace of Alba (still quick nevertheless), he has everything you could want in a full back or even a midfielder. Brilliant passing and crossing, decent dribbling and adequate defensive stats. Stamina is also a bonus. Still good to have Alba whom offers a different threat.

RBs:

Silva (75 L25) - He's a player who caught my eye because of his fantastic dribbling and passing stats for a silver. Possibly one of the best attacking silver right back's, quick enough and decent stamina, however doesn't offer much defensive reinforcement. Will undoubtedly keep his spot in my silver 11.

Semedo (81 L30) - Very much like Alba although lacks a bit in defence. Another decent attacking full back but he's just not that special. There are much better options available.

Bellerin (82 L27) - I think he has to be up there as one of the best right backs the game has to offer. Immediately you notice that ridiculous pace, meaning it‚Äôs almost impossible to beat him down the wing if you track your marker. Defensive stats are good enough and he can put in a decent cross. Can‚Äôt ask for much more really. Needs a haircut.

Dani Carvajal (82 L25) - Just like Alaba on the left, Carvajal is the complete right back. Some might say his attacking stats are lacking, but he‚Äôs certainly quick enough, decent at dribbling and a good crosser. Stamina is crucial for this position and he has plenty of it. Then the defensive stats, the best on any right back. Good to have such a balanced player for this position, making him my favourite right back so far.


*MIDFIELDERS:*


DMFs:

Luckassen (76 L23) - A tenacious and physically strong defensive midfielder that has a turn of pace and a decent tackle. Can also play centre back exceptionally well. A good addition to any silver team.

Radoja (77 L28) - Just about everything you want in a silver defensive midfielder - decent passing, defence and physicality. A little slow but nonetheless a solid choice. Think of him as the silver Busquets because that‚Äôs exactly how he plays.

Seri (79 L17) - Is essentially the gold Kante, runs around endlessly and offers a decent range of passing and strong dribbling stats for his position. Not the most physical but that can't be expected at his height. 

Wanyama (79 L20) - Even at level 20 he is a force to be reckoned with. Tank would be the word to best describe him, almost impossible to dispossess and drives forward with the ball effortlessly. The definition of a destroyer. He‚Äôs earned my recommendation.

Thiago Motta (81 L27) - Not much good I can say here. Just too slow, gets caught out by most players. Decent at passing but he can‚Äôt get in good positions to use it. Unless you have no other option in this position, do not use him.

Fabinho (83 L28) - A very complete player at this position, surprisingly quick and has a decent range of passing. Does what should be expected in this position and more.

Casemiro (83 L27) - Stats wise he looks like a fantastic defensive midfielder and tackling is his bread and butter. Very physical and decent passing for a gold. Unfortunately his condition (D) shows a lot of the time and he seems to go missing a lot. Hit and miss.

CMFs:

Renato Sanches: (77 L20) - Such a dominant midfielder, a powerhouse, just as good at powering through the defence as he is at intercepting and stopping plays. Quick and powerful. Highly regarded for a reason. Scouted for 20k (West Glamorgan City + Portugal).

Allan (79 L29) - Very defensively minded for this position, not particularly a great playmaker but he can break up attacks well. Plays much better in the right back position where his stamina and tackling are more useful, however given my right back options I‚Äôm not inclined to use him. Squad player at best.

√ñzyakup (80 L31) - Absolute gem of a midfielder, great range of passing and immense dribbling, can wriggle out of the tightest of spaces. Strong enough and quick enough to glide past opponents. If there's one player who goes under the radar in this game its him. 

Zielinski (81 L27) - Similar to √ñzyakup in his passing and dribbling but just doesn't feel quite as good. Can be amazing in one game and go missing the next. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm going to use him that often given the depth I have in this position.

Rabiot (81 L25) - Quite honestly a brilliant box to box midfielder who‚Äôs stats are very well rounded. Strong, good dribbler and passer, great tackler and decent stamina, all the ingredients for this position. Quite a fun player to use and certainly a good alternative to Paulinho.

Paulinho (81 L20) ‚Äì I have been using him for a few days now and I have to say so far I‚Äôm not too impressed. Feels a bit awkward on the ball and isn‚Äôt the best passer. However I‚Äôm not going to write him off just yet. Considering how highly praised he is around here I will persevere and try to get him to work better. For now Rabiot is my favourite gold box to box midfielder.

Kovacic (82 L27) - A tenacious, physically strong midfielder who has immense dribbling and passing. Not fantastic at defence and runs out of steam quickly, but can be devastating in attack. A great no. 10 in your midfield three.

Rafinha (83 L35) - He was one of my very first players, acquired from the free Barcelona agent. Good at what he does, finding pockets of space and getting in good positions to create chances. Have a soft spot for him being one of my longest serving players.

Gundogan (84 L20) - Another really decent box to box midfielder. Has fantastic passing and dribbling qualities as well as adequate defensive abilities. Good on the ball and great positional sense off it. Stamina is a little low for a b2b, but other than that he is great.

Pjanic (87 L32) - Phenomenal free kick taker, but that's not the only part to his game. Feels so composed on the ball and can pick out passes with pinpoint accuracy. Not quick or strong but very effective, much like the real life counterpart. One of the best central midfielders in the game.

Modric (89 L30) - Like Kroos he can play superb passes, but Modric is a better player with the ball. His dribbling and ball control are very good, but a lack of strength means he's not the most effective dribbler. If you can work out how to use him he'll work brilliantly. Not as consistent as Kroos.

Kroos (90 L37) - Fantastic midfielder, composed on the ball and without a doubt the best passer in the game. Lofted through balls are effortless. Defensively and physically strong as well. Someone you can count on to create chances in crucial moments. In my opinion he could be the best central midfielder in the game but I haven't used Pogba, Nainggolan or Vidal, so take that with a pinch of salt.

RMFs:

Felipe Anderson (82 L26) - Similar style of play to Salah in that he can speed up and down the wings and get in good positions to score. Quite enjoyable to use, the ball sticks to his feet so he can weave in and out defenders.

Juan Cuadrado (88 L41) - Mr Versatility; this guy can pretty much play every position without too much of a rating drop but his niche is definitely right back. Up there with Carvajal as the best right back I‚Äôve used, despite only being 80 rated in the position. You essentially will be playing with two right wingers because he gets that high up the pitch. Can easily cut inside and brush past defenders with really decent pace and dribbling, whilst still having the ability to put a good ball in the box. Fortunately he has great stamina and is rarely out of position so the right flank will always be covered. Defensive stats are poor at best but he can still tackle to a certain degree. Very skilful on the ball as well, one of the few players I would attempt skills with.

AMFs:

Cardona (77 L35) - Some decent stats here including great passing and dribbling as well as very good balance. Makes him difficult to dispossess and he can run with the ball quite well despite a lack of pace. 

Joaquin Correa (77 L28) - This is a player I didn‚Äôt expect much from but he delivered. Brilliant on the ball, dribbling feels slick, great first touch, can beat a defender for pace and finish well. He‚Äôs also pretty tall which is unusual in this position. Certainly worth scouting if you need a good attacking minded silver player.

Asensio (82 L27) - Haven't used him much lately but he was pretty effective, a decent dribbler and passer, not too strong but versatile as well.

Cabella (83 L35) - For me he's the best gold midfielder in the game. Very quick, great dribbler, physically strong and can pick a pass. Does not get bullied off the ball easily and gets into the right positions to shoot and pass. Everything you could ask for and more.

David Silva (86 L23) - I was quite sceptical of him at first because of the lack of pace and stamina, but aside from that he‚Äôs pretty good. Passing is about as good as you can expect, can unlock defences easily. Dribbling is not bad but I‚Äôm not too inclined to use it with his pace, still can be used to navigate tight spaces. Not going to break into my main team but a useful player to have nonetheless. Hopefully we can see better stats next season given the season he‚Äôs had.

James Rodriguez (87 L37) - The complete attacking package. Can shoot, pass and dribble exceptionally well. Quick and strong enough for an attacking midfielder as well. I think he is probably one of the best midfielders in terms of shooting, he is lethal from distance. Easily a top 5 attacking midfielder in the game.


*FORWARDS:*


LWFs:

Rafa Silva (78 L28) - What a fantastic silver winger, plays a lot like Salah in the way he gets beyond the defence and can finish (despite his atrocious 60 finishing he seems to be able to finish most chances). A great dribbler and a seriously quick player. Does lack strength but usually the pace can take him beyond the defence. It‚Äôs a shame he can‚Äôt be scouted. Takes up the perfect positions and gets in the right places at the right times.

Ahmed Musa (78 L28) - Another player who is very quick, but doesn‚Äôt offer alot else. Gets in good positions to knock the ball in but he‚Äôs not a great passer or dribbler. Useful in the right situations.

Bolasie (80 L24) - One of my favourite gold players to use, he‚Äôs seriously fun to play with. Dribbling is silky smooth and works in tandem with terrific pace so beating defenders is pretty easy. His strength on the ball is what sets him apart from other players in this position, he simply cannot be knocked off the ball easily. Despite rather poor passing and shooting he is surprisingly effective because he will usually find space to get in the box and score an easy tap in. I think he can probably rival San√© as one of the best gold players in this position.

Douglas Costa (85 L29) - He‚Äôs good at what he does but he‚Äôs a bit of a speed merchant. Fantastic with the ball and plenty quick enough to get past the defence, but lacks a decent pass or shot. Not bad though and I look forward to using him at level 30.

Alexis Sanchez (89 L30) - A very good all round attacker, can pass, dribble and shoot, all very well. Doesn‚Äôt stand out in any area but doesn‚Äôt have any weaknesses. Has the stamina to last the game as well. Quite a versatile player, can even do a job at striker for me and is surprisingly good at heading despite his small size (5‚Äô6‚Äù).

RWFs:

Eduardo Salvio (79 L22) - Didn‚Äôt expect much to begin with but this player pleasantly surprised me. A good dribbler with a decent turn of pace, enough to beat a defender. Decent shooting and great positional awareness. A great sub for Salah if he gets tired, but equally capable of playing the whole game.

Mo Salah (86 L32) - Can‚Äôt really explain how good he is. Play a through ball to him and he will do the rest. Immense dribbling and combined with the pace means he‚Äôs good enough to beat any player. Doesn‚Äôt have any significant weaknesses either. The perfect attacker for this game and very rarely goes missing. With the season he‚Äôs having he‚Äôs going to be one hell of a player in next year‚Äôs game.

Robben (89 L30) ‚Äì Such a joy to play with, plays exactly as he would in real life, cutting in on the left to curl one in and it works quite well. Dribbling is outstanding so he can easily get beyond the defence. Finishing is top class as well so he won‚Äôt let you down in front of goal. It‚Äôs a shame he won‚Äôt be in the game next year (unless he leaves Bayern which is possible with his contract expiring).

SSs:

Fekir (80 L20) - A player that has all the right qualities for this position. Very strong on the ball and hard to dispossess, not exceptionally quick but has a great first touch to create space. Good finisher and creates good opportunities the players around him. Easily scoutable and thoroughly worth it.

Dybala (89 L35) - Probably my favourite player to use. A wizard on the ball, seems to so effortlessly turn his marker and lethal when cutting inside. I don‚Äôt take many long shots but he‚Äôs the best player I‚Äôve used from distance, his close range finishing is top notch too. A decent free kick taker as well (provides a good option from the right side as Pjanic is right footed). Just about quick enough and lasts the whole game. I use him as a second striker on either wing and can also do a job as a striker or attacking midfielder. Fantastic player.

Maradona (98 L35) - I was fortunate enough to get him in the free legend pull (thanks Konami!). My god does he feel slow, even with speed in the 80s and explosive power in the 90s, he really feels much slower, maybe it‚Äôs his size. Fortunately I‚Äôm not someone who abuses pace, so he is very usable when used effectively. Dribbling is maxed (99) and the ball stays glued to his feet. Skills are effective but there‚Äôs little need when you can just weave in and out the defenders with basic dribbling. A joy to use. Playmaking is also great, probably rack up more assists than goals with this guy. Shooting within the box is almost a guaranteed goal, he always knows where the target is and curling in from the edge is effortless. No doubt he performs like one of the best players in the game, but the performances aren‚Äôt quite 98 rated.

CFs:

Roger Mart√≠nez (77 L20) - Another player I didn‚Äôt hesitate to scout because he seemed great value (10k + free scouts). Epitomises the perfect striker; pace, strength, finishing and dribbling. Certainly not going to create any chances because his passing is quite honestly awful but in terms of an out and out striker there‚Äôs no better silver.

Welbeck (79 L24) - Bit of a surprise package, was not expecting a lot from him but he provides a decent attacking threat. He‚Äôs relatively fast, strong and a decent dribbler. Not the best gold striker but he‚Äôs decent enough (dreadful in real life).

Firmino (83 L30) - Not the tallest or the quickest, but a great striker; gets in great positions and can create great chances for others. Good dribbling means he can create his own space in the box and finish. Equally capable at attacking midfield. 

Giroud (85 L35) - When people talk about the best gold strikers you hear about Vardy, Mbappe, Mandzukic etc, but rarely Giroud. Probably because of his lack of speed, but for his style of play it doesn‚Äôt hold him back. If you put a good cross in the box, the chances are he will score because he is one of the most dominant players in the air in the game. He‚Äôs equally fantastic at finishing anywhere in the box or on the edge, with immense power if necessary. Unlike most tall and slow strikers, he doesn‚Äôt feel awkward on the ball either, he can easily hold off defenders and keep the ball within his grasp. I hope I‚Äôve made it clear how highly I rate this player, I would honestly take him over some black ball players. Something else I have noticed is he is pretty accurate to the real life Giroud, being so dominant in the air and a handsome Frenchman. PES is very good at authenticity. 

Benzema (87 L30) - Here we have probably the most hated striker in this game. For me he‚Äôs one of the best. The most clinical player I have, gobbles up most chances you give him. He‚Äôs excellent on the ball as well, has the dribbling and balance to jostle with defenders and win duels. Scores the occasional header, not his speciality though (although I don‚Äôt play a lot of crosses for him to head in). Can‚Äôt fault him really. Turns up almost every game and does exactly what I expect of him. Also quite a good playmaker for his position. Another complete forward package and I can‚Äôt hesistate to say he‚Äôs a top five centre forward in the game. 


MANAGERS:

Peres (770 4-3-3) - He can be effective in some situations, but not in others. Defensive shape is generally very good and you can defend pretty well. Attacking wise he‚Äôs really not the best, players don‚Äôt always make the runs you want and it‚Äôs easy to get caught offside. Fundamentally though, he‚Äôs not that fun to play with and that‚Äôs what it comes down to.

Betencourt (660 4-3-3) - Has to be up there as one of the best 4-3-3 managers in the game. Let‚Äôs start with the formation: the option to have two AMFs and two wingers. Whilst I don‚Äôt recommend using both AMF spots, just the one is a game changer for me. Unlike a standard 4-3-3 you‚Äôre going to have someone just behind your striker offering support or being there to tap in. I haven‚Äôt tried the defensive tactic because it doesn‚Äôt provide AMFs, but the attacking tactic has become my first choice. Players will make the perfect runs for you, whether it be down the wings or through the middle. Even using Giroud, he manages to find pockets of space in behind the defence which he can easily score from. Furthermore, my defence is holding up pretty well as well, cutting out chances isn‚Äôt too difficult and even Aubameyang can be easily dealt with, with the right players. Online games are becoming less stressful and more enjoyable because of this manager (unless of course you encounter a cheat).

Pekerman (610 4-3-3) - Probably the most attacking manager there is. Whilst I‚Äôm not inclined to play 3 strikers (because I‚Äôm not r/madlads), he‚Äôs still great to use with SSs on either side because they maintain quite a wide position but come into the box when needed. Usually players will just pile forward into the box giving you the best opportunity to score albeit leaving you slightly exposed at the back. I‚Äôve heard people say the defence is terrible but honestly it‚Äôs not that bad if you use the defensive tactic. At least with this tactic your defence will retain some kind of shape and organisation. 


*AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:*


In defence I would like at least another black ball centre back to rival Koscielny (someone in the mould of Boateng or Ramos). In midfield I could do with a physical box to box player (Pogba, Nainggolan or Vidal would be perfect). In attack I am happy with my wingers but another striker would be welcome. Of course I would happily take Ronaldo and Messi as well.
In the managerial department, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm looking for another manager at the moment. Betencourt is a winning formula for me and I can‚Äôt see why I would want to change. I also couldn‚Äôt see me going for a different formation, because I think I would find it hard to adapt. Who knows, I may get bored and invest in a new manager, especially considering the high management skill period.


*SUMMARY:*


If you are interested in scouting some of the good value players I‚Äôve mentioned, you can visit the [*Budget Scouting Megathread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/pesmobile/comments/87u9vm/budget_scouting_megathread/). This thread also includes some other players which I don‚Äôt have, and all players are under 100k if not under 50k.

Well I think that concludes another squad report. I haven‚Äôt reviewed every player in my squad because I simply haven‚Äôt used everyone, but that is 65/100 players so the majority are there. Hopefully this has been helpful in some way and I thank you for reading right to the end. I will be happy to answer any questions about the players/managers I‚Äôve reviewed.

"Some background on this, my mom sent me on a run to buy some more dog food at a big box store. And from this tale and the stereotypes of employees and customers there, I think you may know what store this may be already LOL

Anyway, I was holding this 15 pound bag of dog food in my arms (I looked like a little kid with a big stuffed animal or something. Some people even giggled when I was hugging the bag to me. It was massive) and I walked to self checkout. Because it was only one big bag, I didn‚Äôt want to wait in a line to checkout.

Anyway, I approach the self checkout. It was busy that day and I was looking for an open kiosk to check out in. When an older Filipino employee (let‚Äôs call her Lola, grandma in Tagalog) kisses her teeth at me and says ‚ÄúOI!‚Äù And then points to an open machine. I smile, because I don‚Äôt want to start anything, and place the bag of dog food on the kiosk.

I go to pick it up to scan it on the scanner. I actually never handled a big bag of dog food like this and I didn‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs scanning guns for this type of stuff, so I was trying to scan it by swiping it across the plate. It wasn‚Äôt working.

The Lola walks up behind me and says ‚ÄúOI! Use this!!!‚Äù In a very rude manner before picking up the scanning gun and scans it for me. I see her kiss her teeth and roll her eyes before she walks away again.

As I was about to pay, I hear a woman diagonal to me at another register asking a question about coupons to the Lola.

Woman: So if I want to use a coupon, I can scan it here, right? (She was being very nice when talking to this Lola. I could almost hear a smile in her voice.

Lola: ‚Äú... sure, sure, whatever. Just use it.‚Äù

I was getting really annoyed at this Lola‚Äôs behavior at this point because she was being a jerk for no reason to these people.

The machine in front of me said ‚Äúselect payment type‚Äù and as I was going to push on the ‚ÄúDebit‚Äù card option on the screen, little old Lola runs over to me, screaming:

‚ÄúOI WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU‚ÄôRE DOING?!‚Äù

I was ticked off. Completely lost it. I looked at her, debit card clenched in my hand, and screamed back ‚ÄúTRYING TO USE MY DEBIT CARD!!!‚Äù

She walked away without a word and I was able to pay for the dog food and then left.

I texted my mom about ‚Äúthis really rude Lola‚Äù who screamed at me and was being very rude to other customers. My mom told me that when her and my stepdad (also Filipino, I consider him my dad so I‚Äôll call him dad for the rest of this) went to that same location for ‚Äòafter Christmas sales‚Äô, they had a problem with her as well. My dad proceeded to chew her out and said ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt treat people like this! What‚Äôs wrong with you?!‚Äù My mom called corporate right after it happened, but I guess nothing was done, because Lola did the same thing to me when I went in there a couple months after. Both my mom and dad decided to call corporate AGAIN after my incident.

I walked in that store a week later to get what I needed and when I went to self checkout, Lola wasn‚Äôt there.

I know that, well, how I was raised, we need to respect our older Lola‚Äôs and Lolo‚Äôs, but I couldn‚Äôt respect her. I do hope she got fired...

"Reddit has been experimenting with a new default look for the website, and it is slated to be in-use full-time starting soon.

You can see how this sub will look at: https://new.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/

Reddit has been working on the redesign for a while, with user commentary being mostly negative. They have asked for feedback, and have said they will make changes; however, as the redesign is eminent and still few changes have been implemented, it is looking like we are going to have it handed to us as-is. 

Some of the less savory aspects of the redesign:

- Ads are inserted directly into a sub, and are made to look like posts from users. These are treated as 'static' ads, and currently ad-blockers do not remove/hide them.
- User Flair. I know we do not use it here, but most subs do. In the redesign, flair is limited to 15x15 px, which is so tiny as to render most images indistinguishable blotches. 
- Link Flair. Every post here has a link flair assigned to it ([CPU], [MONITOR], etc). These are used to categorize post, and allows people to skim through and pick deals that are more relevant to them. Besides being a handy way to categorize post for easier indexing, they allowed users to search for deals. It looks like that feature is not available in the redesign, although you can still manually search for a product. *It's possible this function will be added later though*
- CSS. I know the design work I have done here isn't exactly loved, so maybe this one won't be as upsetting to some of you? But once the redesign goes live for everyone, you will be forced to use their new layout, with no ability to change or alter it in any way. 
- Sidebar: Even what we have in our sidebar is being taken away. The new redesign will use 'widgets', that do have some functionality but will not allow us to improvise as much with what we can put on a sidebar.

link to the ProCSS sub: /r/ProCSS


If I had to summarize the new reddit redesign,  I would say it is a dumbed down user experience geared to draw in the facebook crowd. 

This isn't a call to arms, just a general heads-up of events that are forthcoming that we (individual sub mods) have no control over.

"It‚Äôs a warm day. Yesterday‚Äôs laser eye surgery seems to have gone ok. At first your eyes were a little fuzzy but they seem to be all cleared up and you can see so much more clearly now. Having booked a couple of days off for recovery it‚Äôs nice to be sat at the pavement caf√© enjoying a cold drink. All around people are shedding layers, sipping from water bottles and enjoying cooling ice\-creams.

‚ÄúArrgh!‚Äù You hear the scream and see the woman jump up from her table. Wafting arms warding off the unseen terror.  

A bee no doubt. You have never understood this ridiculous over reaction people have to bees. The sun and the abundance of sugary treats and drinks brings them out in force. ‚ÄúGet it away from me, get it away from me!‚Äù Wow, she‚Äôs really going to town. It‚Äôs just a bee, the worst it can do is sting you.  

That‚Äôs when it comes towards you. It hovers near your face for a while, flying in the way they do, seeming to scan the profile of your face with it‚Äôs to and fro flying pattern. It lands on your hand and you notice its proboscis shoots out and touches your skin, you don‚Äôt even feel it, but you see it. Your vision is so much clearer now after the surgery. You see something you have never seen before. Something tiny on its proboscis, it reaches around and deposits it on its hairy back legs. There are hundreds of them. The tiniest particles. It‚Äôs DNA. You don‚Äôt know how you know, but you know. It‚Äôs impossible, DNA is microscopic, even so you know it to be true. That bee has just collected your entire genetic code.  

It flies off nonchalantly and you follow, hypnotised by its meandering flight. You watch it fly from table to table, a flick of its proboscis and another collection is made, and another, and another. You continue to follow it into the local park where it flies to its nest.  

Intrigued and throwing caution to the wind you grab stick from the floor and cover as much of your bare skin as possible with your clothes and you poke at the nest. It crashes to the floor and cracks open. The swarm rises confused but you stare in horror at the broken nest on the floor.  

Stuck against the walls are thousands of tiny translucent, squirming larvae. Each one has a tiny, perfect human face, mouths gaping, desprate to feed.  You see your own face.

The adult bees fly towards you now and you scream and bat them away in panic. ‚ÄúGet them away from me, get them away from me!‚Äù",False,0,False,"Bees Don't Only Make Honey","r/shortscarystories",False,6,0,"","all_ads",True,"t3_8gyu6w",False,"dark","public",21,"self.shortscarystories","",False,False,False,21,"self",False,True,"text",6,"text",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"richtext",False,"t5_2t6kz","8gyu6w",0,3,True,"/r/shortscarystories/comments/8gyu6w/bees_dont_only_make_honey/","all_ads",False,"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/8gyu6w/bees_dont_only_make_honey/",201337,False,False,2048,"best"
"I‚Äôm one of three people who work at a Chinese buffet that *aren‚Äôt* Chinese. I‚Äôve been there for a while and can do everything - serve, host, cashier, manage. It was a fast lunch hour and the entire restaurant, that can seat 328, was full. Out of the 8 servers there, only 2/8 have above average English skills. I figured it was only fair I learn mandarin to be able to communicate properly, and because of this I believe I earned their respect and they truly accepted me into the family.                                 

I‚Äôm at the register ringing people up and notice there‚Äôs a line of about 10 waiting for seats. I let the other cashier take over and I go to check for tables to see if I can get these *clearly* grumpy people seated. I find a few tables and come back and start taking the groups one at a time. I only had 4 clean tables that could seat up to 4 people, and the last group was 8.


 I was about to explain that I didn‚Äôt have a table for them at the moment and it would be a 15-20 minute wait, and the extremely overweight redneck goes ‚ÄúFinally, someone that speaks American.‚Äù I was a little taken back and didn‚Äôt say anything, just said what I intended to say. 

Then he goes  ‚ÄúActually, you‚Äôre a little darker than I was expecting. We might not speak the same language either,‚Äù and let‚Äôs out this disgustingly .... *moist* laugh. Everyone he was with laughed too, even the CHILDREN. I walked away and they sat down to wait. While they were waiting, the kids ran around unattended. They put their hands in the ice cream, they put their hands in the fishpond, they went in the servers station pulling at the sides of their eyes and saying ‚ÄúDing ding dong Ching Chong‚Äù. One of the hostesses walked them back to their family and asked them to please watch their children (before we knew they had ruined $200 worth of ice cream) and they told her not to try to put their kid on a mountain because she‚Äôs a girl and ‚ÄúKids are supposed to play, not ring up take out‚Äù and side eyed one of the younger cashiers. Who‚Äôs 22. That was the last straw for me. 

While I was thinking of a good reason to kick them out, one of the servers tells me their customer saw the kids playing in the ice cream. We have a camera pointed at it for issues like this, so I reviewed the tape and there it was- three little blonde brats sticking their paws straight into the containers. I called one of our personal police officers and of COURSE they made a big show of thanking him for his service the second he walked in. Being thanked for his service is a pet peeve of his, so when I asked him to make them pay the $200 for ice cream and then leave he was excited to do it. He told them what their kids had done, they apologized, paid. Suddenly the racist comments stopped. They asked if they could still dine in, I said yes because it would be another quick $100. Our officer leaves, and less than two minutes later the mom says ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been waiting for almost an hour. This place must run on your people‚Äôs time,‚Äù 

So I go, ‚ÄúSorry about your table, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll have another one for.... 4 hours. There‚Äôs a McDonalds up the street. Please take your gremlins with you.‚Äù They  tried to complain to my manager, who just backed me up. Even asked for the corporate number. It‚Äôs a small business, sir. That number doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù isn‚Äôt a language and judging people by their skin color isn‚Äôt cool. If you don‚Äôt know how to control your kids, leave the little asswipes at home.

"Hey guys, I've been lurking in the forums for a while and read some great feedback for the devs about the issue. 

I decided to compile everything and post it here.

[1] ''I agree on the concept of people not valuing the collection in the same sense of value that MTG players are accustomed to, but the tradeoff is that we need access to more of the cards we want to play, to gve our collections our personal sense of value.''

**[2] ''The reason for me that the MTGA collection doesn't feel like it has value is mostly that it doesn't even feel like MY collection. I can't do anything with anything once I get it, can't trade it, can't sell it, can't destroy it, and can only create cards very very rarely when I'm lucky enough to get a wildcard. Just feels more something that Wotc controls and lets me play with rather than a collection that I get control over.''**

[3] ''I don't feel like your team understands that having lots of cards hold no value to many players, and we want 75 specific cards and the rest isn't worth anything. This translates into my feeling that the economy is designed around this model that all cards should be valuable to me, and frankly they're not, only 75 cards are valuable, and everything else is worthless. The lack of value to me isn't a lack of monetary value, it's a lack of play value, 99% of the cards in my collection are just disappointments that they're not something else.''

[4] ''MTGA cards, of course, have no resale value. Therefore, they should be judged purely as disposable entertainment, such as a movie rental or downloaded video game. If we evaluate MTGA boosters purely on this basis, it is even more clear that they are grossly overpriced.

**To be even more clear, compare the $90 booster bundle to a AAA video game, such as The Witcher 3, which costs roughly half. No reasonable person would argue that $90 of MTGA boosters, which by some estimates gives access to 1.5-2.5 Tier 1 decks, provides the same entertainment value.**

"First some explanation, I've been out as mtf for two years now to my parents (and basically everyone) and am currently pre-hrt still because that shit is expensive and Walmart isn't cutting it.

So yesterday I was chatting with my mom talking to her about shaving, because it's getting warmer weather (shaving for me is a must). I was saying whenever I shaved it's seems like enough for an entire cat XD. To which she replied, ""You can blame testosterone for that"". And then despite not being in the conversation my Dad says ""I think you looked better with shorter hair"", just completely out of the blue. I shrugged it off, as I don't want shorter hair.

So today I'm getting the ride home from Walmart, and we have the windows down which is causing my hair to go everywhere. So he says ""If you're gonna have long hair, you should at least keep it in a ponytail."" I told him I don't like doing that because my hair is so thick that when I do have a ponytail, it's looks like a feather duster out the back of my head. He then says ""Well you know what you could also do..."" I then proceeded to cut him off and say ""Yeah, I know, I could get it layered."" He responds with ""Yeah... but with knowing how long your hair is, you could donate it to Locks of Love for cancer patients so they can have wigs. Lots of people do it."" I see this as him trying to guilt trip me into doing that an having a shorter haircut, which I don't want to do, because I've gotten to a point despite not having gone through hrt or anything, people I don't know see me as a woman.

Has anything similar happened to you before? And what should I do?

"My dad divorced the mom my senior year after being urged by a lawyer to get me out of that house. I haven't spoken to either step-sister or the mom in 8 years since I left state for college. My sister (*Em*) still has some friends there (even though she moved states as well) and kept minor contact with them.

Em called me today and said, ""I don't know if you care but *Ronnie* was in a bad car accident last night. A kid died.""

While talking on the phone with Em, I started googling and reading articles about the crash. She was driving in the wrong lane (the emergency lane/shoulder, I believe) and hit a car with children that had broken down. One died at the scene and I don't know if she might be looking at charges or not.

Damn. She put me through hell. All of them. I hated my life when I lived there. I was shy and awkward, but I had just been ripped away from my home before with absolutely no notice. I admit I held a lot of anger. But what they added...

I'm glad my life is entirely different. I left it all behind and never looked back. But I still would have never wished that on them.

Damn.

"To be clear, I was a grunt tier 2 tech, late night cellular tech support, not a VP. Light staffing, few calls. Same customer called in at least 3 times in an hour complaining that we owe him a new phone because the screen broke when he put a screwdriver through it. I volunteered to handle the customer when he calls back, but to give me a proper introduction.

My buddy: ""Sir, our VP of call center operations is visiting tonight and I hear his helicopter now. Would you like to address this with him?"" The hook was set.

After a reasonable hold, appropriate to exiting a chopper and entering the building, I took the call. ""Sir, I'm the vice president of call center operations and my tech tells me you have a broken phone that we won't replace it because of the type of damage. Is that right?"" Yessir. ""And it's only because of the screwdriver through the screen?"" Yessir. ""Dammit! Sir, I assure you it is not our intent to deny servicing our loyal customers such as yourself. I have a meeting in the morning and with your permission I'd like to use this as an example."" Yessir, yes, of course. ""I know for certain nothing will change with regard to your phone, but with this example, your example, I can assure you that this policy will undergo extensive review."" Thank you sir.

I never gave my name, never gave him an opportunity to really say much, I just bulldozed along.
