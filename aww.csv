With grinding noises no amount of WD-40 could lubricate both the owner and the dog got pulled into the teeth of the machine, screams and yelps of agony echoing through the mall until suddenly, nothing.  

One lone pink heart shaped balloon floats above the escalator, on top of the crowd holding their open mouth gasps and clutching their cell phones, the witnesses to this murder of love by the uncaring, cold machine who still churns, unsatisfied.

"RoundTwoElectric","My dog does this!
When she was a puppy I donated a stuffed toy from when I was younger for her to snuggle up to; it was this sheep from build-a-bear workshop that promptly became ""Mummy"". She'd carry Mummy around everywhere with her.
One day my brother, a teenager and certified idiot at the time, decided for some reason unbeknownst to anyone, I'm sure including him now, to attach Mummy to a lightbulb. I think he thought the dog would find it entertaining somehow. Unsurprisingly, Mummy was singed by the time I got back from school. She was no longer a sheep, but four limbs and a head connected by a thread. 
This would not do. We had to replace Mummy. Unfortunately nothing seemed to appease my dog, who at this point was in a deep phase of mourning. In a last-ditch attempt me and my dad decided to try her with another build-a-bear creation; they're all the same shape, near enough, maybe that'd keep her happy. So two adults are in the queue for the stuffing machine, teddy bear skin in hand. 
""Would you like to put a sound box in it?""
""No thank you.""
""Do you want to put a heart in it and make a wish?"" 
""Miss, this is for my ridiculous spaniel, not for me. Thank you but I don't think she has any particular wishes.""
We get to the counter and a new woman asks if we'd like a birth certificate, my dad almost breaks. 
Fortunately for him, ""Puppy"" has been a [smash hit](https://imgur.com/gallery/oWh37) ",379,0,"aww","/r/aww/comments/89tkhd/this_very_good_girl_got_a_squeaky_reindeer_from/",543

 I will throw in a little story with this.   I walked my old Lab daily.  It was a mobile home park and my dog was like clockwork.  She knew what houses to hit and what time someone would be around to give her a cookie, even neighbors who didn't own dogs bought cookies for her....   My dog would stop in front of her house and not budge every day in view from the womans recliner, she would come out or invite my dog into her house for a cookie or hot dog.    This was a daily thing for years.

 One night my dog had severe nightmares that went on 5 days in a row, she hadn't had nightmares like that since I first found her 12 years prior since she was abused.   I attributed it to possibly old age, since she was around  13 or so.

 On the 6th day after the nightmares she went a different route rather than to the womans house, I found that odd, attributed it to the possible old age.   I found out that evening she had been taken to the hospital she was found unresponsive, found out next day she passed away.

 My dog didn't stop in front of her house again a few times she did, the neighbors next to her also fed my dog also but it was rare and the nightmares went away.  I believe my dog knew she was sick.

Those daily walks kept my dog alive and kicking till a little after her 17th birthday.  No complaints.",1,2,"aww","/r/aww/comments/89s9ga/patient_dog_walks_extremely_slow_so_that_the_old/",637

I've easily had over a dozen concussions, and I'm sure I've had plenty others that I didn't really think were concussions. Now in my 30's, I stumble over my words and have a hard time connecting my thoughts to my mouth. I think just fine, and I can write out my thoughts just fine, but it's like when I'm talking, my brain just doesn't want to connect to my vocal chords. Basic conversation is fine, but subjects that take more thought take a lot of effort and I have a hard time explaining things even if I know the topic very well. 


I don't even know if it's related honestly. Maybe it's just a minor disability that I was always going to have. I still train, still get hit in the head, it's the only thing that helps relieve stress from my job and the only sport that I've never gotten tired of. As much as I care about being able to think clearly, I do also care just as much about my body, and being in the best shape possible. I love being in my 30's and being able to school my younger teammates when we're sparring or grappling. If either part of me, my body or my brain goes, it'll be like living hell for me.

She asked me a bit earlier on in the battle what she should do: fight it or just go.  I told her to please fight because there was a chance she could recover, and maybe I was just being naive and selfish.

I still feel al kinds of guilt about the 3 months between diagnosis and her passing, and I‚Äôm still a bit traumatized by having experienced it (it was not peaceful).

But when my quality of life is low enough, I absolutely hope someone will have the courage to put me out of my misery if I‚Äôm unable to make that decision.

"phyxius90","Where else should the money be spent? Wars? Going to Mars? Of course there are issues and problems in the world that need money and resources besides longevity, however I think we can afford to put a little more funding and resources into the research. At the moment it has none because most people don't see it as a viable or even possible thing to achieve and a large portion are just too negative and think they'll miss the boat anyway to see the benefits themselves. 

To achieve longevity lots of things need to be solved. All the common diseases that we are more subject to when we age like cancer, cardiovascular disease, parkinsons and alzheimer‚Äôs need to be taken care of. The amount of money that is spent to support people with these conditions is substantial. Age care is a huge industry. What if we could take that away? People won't get the diseases of old age and we can all concentrate on walking our dogs. Once we cure aging we may not even need a cure for diseases of old age as they will already be taken care of like alzheimer‚Äôs. 

Now as for the classic statement of 'it will only be for the rich'. Yes, you are correct, it will be. Initially. However as time passes (5-10 years) and the technology establishes and the manufacturing processes are made more efficient it will inevitably become cheaper. Significantly cheaper. There will be a huge demand for it and companies will want to capitalise.

Honey is 80+% sugar, so all of the water that is in the honey is bound up by the sugar and is unavailable for the bacteria. In addition to that, if the bacteria did germinate in the honey, the sugar would cause increased osmotic pressure and rip water right out of the bacteria, killing it.",6,8,"aww","/r/aww/comments/89t85b/heard_crinkling_noises_coming_from_the_pantry/",6

"Sloots_and_Hoors","Generally, you don't want a dog- puppy or otherwise to chew on you.  It's bad manners that can transfer into adulthood.

The best approach is to just let the puppy not do it.  Distract it or get your hand out of the way.  A dog like a lab will realize fairly quickly that it gets what it wants when it doesn't bite.  The other good thing to do is push down between the pup's shoulder blades when it tries to gnaw on you.  If you do this, you need to follow through and roll the pup on its back.  It will help the pup understand that you're in control.  This shouldn't be the only approach though.  Mix it up.  The big takeaway is not letting the dog do it.",4,2,"aww","/r/aww/comments/89qu1z/learning_to_be_a_good_boy_is_so_tough_when_you/",8

Her other dog did not accept him and bullied him around constantly so she had to give him up. So we have taken him in. He is my first dog, my SO has a ton of dog experience though so both him and me are learning.

He is such a nice and calm dog. Very intelligent and eager to learn :)

After a few of hours we went back and checked and he was still there so we took him home with us.  We bottle fed him, and we learned that cow milk gives fawns the worst diarrhea and that they need milk replacer instead.  I think the one we got was intended for baby goats.  This was before you could google the right way to take care of them. 

He was really nice and was always excited to see people, wagged his tail kind of like a dog.  He couldn‚Äôt walk on linoleum, slid around like it was ice.

"zwingo","I live on a golf course that has had deer roaming for many generations, so much so that they don‚Äôt mind people anymore. They will nap five feet from the tee, and just watch people golf, or if you are in your garden they will walk right up to you and eat a plant a foot away. But the one thing they still don‚Äôt fuck around with are their babies. I have watched multiple dumbass golfers try to pet the babies laying in the grass, only to get chased off by multiple full grown momma deer.

I tell you all that because every year for a few months I have to employ every last bit of my power to not go pick up and cuddle those adorable little things. They are just so damn cute.

It also sucks because when the herd roams through the neighborhood to munch plants, you gotta chase them off your lawn. If you don‚Äôt your plants are dead. Not that hard with the adults, but when you go out to yell at them, and a tiny baby is standing there nibbling the end of the lowest plant, it‚Äôs near impossible to go through with it.

Eventually she gave it to a wildlife shelter when she realized it wasn't going to get tame and she couldn't afford the gland removal surgery. (This was when we were like 18.)

As any living thing should, really, but I still can't comprehend why people think of monkeys and apes as merely animals, they're our cousins and they show it. Some even speak in sign language. And it isn't just ""I'm hungry"" ""give me the banana"" that they talk about.

If I showed you a gif of someone bathing a baby Bigfoot would you believe that Bigfoot existed? No you'll want more proof.

Some places will let you hold and bathe baby orangutans.  Of course everyone wants to do that, and thinks that it must be good for the animals or the sanctuary wouldn't be doing it.  But there's no benefit to the animals and there are significant risks.  Orangutans are susceptible to a lot of human carried viruses, including the common cold, but their reactions could be a lot worse.  It's also not good to get an orangutan used to human contact because that guarantees they'll never be released to the wild or semi-wild.

This isn't to say the cute gif we're looking at is necessarily a bad thing.  We don't know enough about why the baby is being bathed.  The person doing the bathing is likely a local staff member who the orangs are individually familiar with, but this doesn't necessarily translate to a trust of all people.

"Wormsblink","The problem is not palm oil itself but how palm plantations are done in Southeast Asia.

The vast majority of palm oil is produced by smallholders (family run). These Farmers lack any machinery or fertilizer so they will conduct slash-and-burn agriculture, to clear forest space for farmland and the ashes will serve as fertilizer. Needless to say, this is terrible for all wildlife in the area.

Because the industry relies on smallholds, it is impossible to regulate. The Farmers are known to illegally clear some land deep in the forest, even in conservation areas. The government is unable to police the entire rainforest and are corrupt enough to bribe if you get caught.

It‚Äôs a shame really, since oil palm is biologically speaking one of the best crops on earth. It is roughly 10 times more efficient in producing oil than the second best option, soybeans. In fact diesel from palm oil would be price competitive to that made from crude oil, reducing our need for fossil fuels.

So don't go right for the downvote button, there's a lot of misinformation about Palm being evil. It's actually THE most efficient way to get oil. The problem is that we are cutting down forest for land for more palm oil. If we were to swap out Palm for say, Soy Oil, or sesame oil, it would take [6-10x as much land to do it](http://theconversation.com/palm-oil-scourge-of-the-earth-or-wonder-crop-42165). 

The biggest contributing factor here, is that it is cheaper to cut down a forest and plant new plants for palm oil, than it is to reuse the land already allocated to farming palm oil. 

Palm is hands down the best oil you can use from an ecological stand point. I reiterate, switching to any other oil is 6-10x worse. So, what can you do?

[This site](https://www.ecowatch.com/find-out-which-companies-responsibly-source-palm-oil-you-might-be-surp-1882028085.html) can help you make decisions about what products you can buy that are responsibly sourced. You also can let the companies in the list that contribute to the problem know that you are no longer buying their products until they source palm oil responsibly. Of course, your one voice means nothing, but if many people do it, there will be change.

"the_straw-man","He's not wrong though. Orangutans only live in Borneo, Indonesia. Deforestation happens on a massive scale, in 20-30 years orangutans probably won't have a habitat in the wild anymore.

Videos like this are amazingly cute--orangutans are incredibly emotional animals, despite being solitary in the wild. I personally think they have the most empathy out of any non-human primate. 

But videos like this are also sad. The orangutan in the video is almost certainly an orphan at a rehabilitation center. The people who work at those are amazingly dedicated and love these animals, but the sad truth is their habitat decreases daily due to the growth of palm oil plantations (and palm oil is in almost everything, so it's not slowing anytime soon). 

Many orangutans are orphaned because their parents are killed or separated from them in these plantations, which orangutans wander onto because maybe in their childhood, it was lush jungle but now it's a farm. They get stuck in wells, killed by farmers for stealing food, etc. and the infants are often taken as pets, chained up and left to die because these people soon realize that they have no idea how to take care of orangutans.

It's not uncommon for orangutan infants to come into rescue centers severely traumatized from emotional and physical neglect:

These animals need love and care.

Luckily, thanks to rehabilitation centers directly formed and structured by passionate primatologists, they usually turn out alright:

"Cranes","Heyo. There's a lot of ""issue"" places in poor countries where tourism money is more important than wildlife conservation. Heck, some organizations have actually been accused of fueling the ""cute baby orangutan that tourists come to see"" industry (e.g., fueling the black market exotic animal trade).

**Trust me, legitimate conservation organizations do not advocate touching wild animals.** Would someone in North America ever say touching wild animals is good for them? No way. As it is, experts are tracking and monitoring mountain gorillas extensively and constantly run vaccine trials on the ""wild"" animals due to the small population and high chance of anthronotic disease. These practices are just more common in low-income countries (where primates tend to live).

Some animals may be ok to touch, but because great apes are so similar to humans we can share many diseases. **Gambling with the fate of endangered animal populations is not good conservation, full stop.**

Source: This is my gf's account but I'm an anthropologist who has volunteered with an orangutan conservation organization created by Dr. Galdikas (and worked with her for a bit). Needed to get all the vaccines, TB tests, and endure the quarantine. 

edit: Even cute videos like this make me uneasy because they just fuel the exotic pet trade. Primates are at such risk, and every baby primate in a video usually means a dead mom and ten other infants that didn't make the boat trip. In this video it looks like a sanctuary but most of the time it isn't and it just ends up making more people want to purchase primates.

There are plenty of small holders too, but burn-and-slash is never done in Peninsular Malaysia (there hadn't been much virgin forest left since the 80s, LOL), and I have never heard of/knew of farmers in Malaysia that do burn-and-slash (that's more of an Indonesia thing). Farmers in Malaysia can afford fertilizers and farming equipment, and land isn't just free-for-all - you can't just start burning and farming without showing you own the land. And land isn't cheap.

With that said, I visited Borneo (Sarawak) recently, and flew into the rural parts. Most of the jungle has been converted into palm oil plantation, and I bet they are owned by companies, and not small holders.

EDIT: Also want to point out that Orangutan is not found everywhere in Malaysia/Indonesia. They are not on Peninsular Malaysia and Java (where most of the population reside in each country). Only in Borneo and Sumatra.",3,3,"aww","/r/aww/comments/89olz9/baby_orangutan_gets_a_bath/",372

There are two main arguments here, one trivial and one more serious. The more trivial reason is that it conflicts directly with holy scripture. Most intelligent Christians have found a way to get past that by not taking their Bible too literally and seeing it in the context that it was written. However, the more serious problem which is often overlooked is that evolution shows that it is quite possible for something complicated to come from something simple without any creator necessarily being involved, that the Universe has developed from the bottom up and not designed from the top down. If design can come from order and order can come from chaos, then what purpose is a God? If the Universe can be proved to be possible without God, then it is reasonable to conclude there is no God. Evolution does lead at some point to Atheism. People in the Bible belt instinctively know this.

If your oil does not originate from Indonesia or Malaysia, and the plant is cultivated locally then it's perfectly good to use.

  


The problem stems from greedy people clearing the forests in those two countries to plant oil palm tree monocultures. Which is where the Orang-Utan lives. So the species is now critically endangered, just because palm oil is extremely cheap to produce.

Any other common refined/treated vegetable oil could be used instead. But Oil palms are so efficient at producing oil that greed wins.
  


Funny (or not so much) anecdote: There is milk substitute available for calves that only contains 30% milk powder and the rest is palm (and coconut) oil. Which is completely insane.

Chimp societies are dominated by the strongest male and control is exerted by force. In terms of anatomy I think there's a strong case to be made that Chimps evolved to rely more on violence than humans. We evolved to be weaker, but to be smarter and more socially complex. Chimps a stronger bite (larger jaws, more pronounced mastoid), more prominent incisors, and more upper body musculature. As far as I've learned (I am not an expert) we evolved to rely on increasingly large social structures for protection and problem solving and chimps evolved sort of in the inverse.

They used these to stab mammoth's in the ankles. Asians and Caucasians all have Neanderthal grandfathers, btw. 

Neanderthals had bigger brains than modern humans AND more muscular bodies. It could be the case that modern humans with smaller brains and less muscular bodies simply outbred Neanderthals, watering down their genes due to requiring less food per person, so larger populations of modern humans were more easy to sustain through requiring less calories.

If i called out someone every time they said ‚Äúrepost‚Äù to something it would be tiring and pointless, so I dont. But i have to ask, cant you just observe it as something you‚Äôve seen before, and not invest time to tell people its been posted ? 
I genuinely am curious what compels you to comment on it, because from my perspective its just a roundabout way of being like ‚Äúive seen this before‚Äù and really what is the point of expressing that when theres probably hundreds of thousands who have never seen it? 

edit: sorry if im responding to the wrong person in this thread, i cant remember if i hit the right comment hahah but no offense here yall just have a different opinion and finally felt like i wanted to ask someone who is bothered by reposts.

You're right but the big difference here is the temperament plus ease of getting the dog.

Tibetian Mastiffs are crazy expensive.  Pitbulls you can find by the bucketful in pounds/shelters.

And Tibetian Mastiffs are protective, not people friendly dogs (they love their owners though).  Pitbulls aren't protective.  They're playful and they generally adore people.

Pit bulls are a lot easier to train because they're a lot more eager to please people.  And they're a lot ""safer"" in that even if you're bad at training, your pitbull will still likely love strangers.  Your badly trained Tibetian Mastiff, will probably attack anyone who invades its territory.",26,2,"aww","/r/aww/comments/89oxqx/half_pomeranian_half_bear/",182

However, because of their breed they can have serious dog aggression problems.

Sure some might not have dog aggression just like some mastiffs might not be aggressive but owners should know the breed. Minus the dog aggression pit bulls also have a strong bite and tend to lock their jaw so owners should know how to break their gripe. They aren't  as big as some may think and can be controlled. Mastiffs are huge and given their aggression would be difficult to control and sometimes don't care about their owners orders let alone another human trying to get them under control so that brings a different danger level to them.",10,2,"aww","/r/aww/comments/89oxqx/half_pomeranian_half_bear/",182

"hrtDaughterOfRa",">Bad is subjective.  These dogs are inherently aggressive though, and to say it's on the owner is irresponsible (not saying you are suggesting that.)  Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Shepherd breeders literally selectively breed the most aggressive dogs.  

You are absolutely right. Perhaps I should have said research the breed *and breeder* because my comment kind of skipped over that side of things. There likely are breeders doing as you suggest, however it would be an unsubstantiated generalization to suggest they all are.  While aggression cannot be wholly blamed on an owner's training ability, the owner also has a responsibility to ensure the breeder is reputable. 
Again it's a matter of research and unfortunately a lot of the big dogs ending up in shelters are there due to an uninformed and unprepared owner. Every breed has its quirks and it is absolutely the responsibility of  potential owners to know what to expect before adopting. For the masses though, maybe sometimes it's easier to suggest that people avoid certain difficult breeds than try to learn how to work with them.
